She was a successful student in high school,\\ngraduating valedictorian and obtaining a National Merit Scholarship for her performance on the PSAT\\nduring her junior year. She was accepted to a university on the opposite side of the state, where she\\nreceived additional scholarships giving her a free ride for her entire undergraduate education. Excited\\nto start this new chapter in her life, Cassie’s parents begin the 5-hour commute to Pullman, where they\\nwill leave their only daughter for the first time in her life.\\nThe semester begins as it always does in mid to late August. Cassie meets the challenge with\\nenthusiasm and does well in her classes for the first few weeks of the semester, as expected. Sometime\\naround Week 6, her friends notice she is despondent, detached, and falling behind in her work. After\\nbeing asked about her condition, she replies that she is “just a bit homesick,” and her friends accept\\nthis answer as it is a typical response to leaving home and starting college for many students. A month\\nlater, her condition has not improved but worsened. She now regularly shirks her responsibilities\\naround her apartment, in her classes, and on her job. Cassie does not hang out with friends like she did\\nwhen she first arrived for college and stays in bed most of the day. Concerned, Cassie’s friends contact\\nHealth and Wellness for help.\\nCassie’s story, though hypothetical, is true of many Freshmen leaving home for the first time to earn a\\nhigher education, whether in rural Washington state or urban areas such as Chicago and Dallas. Most\\nstudents recover from this depression and go on to be functional members of their collegiate\\nenvironment and accomplished scholars. Some students learn to cope on their own while others seek\\nassistance from their university’s health and wellness center or from friends who have already been\\nthrough the same ordeal. These are normal reactions. However, in cases like Cassie’s, the path to\\nrecovery is not as clear. Instead of learning how to cope, their depression increases until it reaches\\nclinical levels and becomes an impediment to success in multiple domains of life such as home, work,\\nschool, and social circles.\\nIn Module 1, we will explore what it means to display abnormal behavior, what mental disorders are,\\nand the way society views mental illness today and how it has been regarded throughout history. Then\\nwe will review research methods used by psychologists in general and how they are adapted to study\\nabnormal behavior/mental disorders. We will conclude with an overview of what mental health\\nprofessionals do.\\n \\nModule Outline\\n1.1. Understanding Abnormal Behavior\\n1.2. Classifying Mental Disorders\\n1.3.

Understanding Abnormal Behavior\\nTo understand what abnormal behavior is, we first have to understand what normal behavior is. Normal\\nreally is in the eye of the beholder, and most psychologists have found it easier to explain what is wrong\\nwith people then what is right. How so?\\nPsychology worked with the disease model for over 60 years, from about the late 1800s into the middle\\npart of the 20th century. The focus was simple – curing mental disorders – and included such pioneers\\nas Freud, Adler, Klein, Jung, and Erickson. These names are synonymous with the psychoanalytical\\nschool of thought. In the 1930s, behaviorism, under B.F. Skinner, presented a new view of human'),\n",

Simply, human behavior could be modified if the correct combination of reinforcements and\\npunishments were used. This viewpoint espoused the dominant worldview of the time – mechanism –\\nwhich presented the world as a great machine explained through the principles of physics and\\nchemistry. In it, human beings serve as smaller machines in the larger machine of the universe.\\nMoving into the mid to late 1900s, we developed a more scientific investigation of mental illness, which\\nallowed us to examine the roles of both nature and nurture and to develop drug and psychological\\ntreatments to “make miserable people less miserable.” Though this was an improvement, there were\\nthree consequences as pointed out by Martin Seligman in his 2008 TED Talk entitled, “The new era of\\npositive psychology.” These are:\\n“The first was moral; that psychologists and psychiatrists became victimologists, pathologizers;\\nthat our view of human nature was that if you were in trouble, bricks fell on you. And we forgot\\nthat people made choices and decisions. We forgot responsibility. That was the first cost.”\\n“The second cost was that we forgot about you people. We forgot about improving normal lives.\\nWe forgot about a mission to make relatively untroubled people happier, more fulfilled, more\\nproductive. And “genius,” “high-talent,” became a dirty word. No one works on that.”\\n“And the third problem about the disease model is, in our rush to do something about people in\\ntrouble, in our rush to do something about repairing damage, it never occurred to us to develop\\ninterventions to make people happier — positive interventions.”\\nStarting in the 1960s, figures such as Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers sought to overcome the\\nlimitations of psychoanalysis and behaviorism by establishing a “third force” psychology, also known as\\nhumanistic psychology. As Maslow said,\\n“The science of psychology has been far more successful on the negative than on the positive side; it\\nhas revealed to us much about man’s shortcomings, his illnesses, his sins, but little about his\\npotentialities, his virtues, his achievable aspirations, or his full psychological height. It is as if\\npsychology had voluntarily restricted itself to only half its rightful jurisdiction, and that the darker,\\nmeaner half.” (Maslow, 1954, p. 354).\\nHumanistic psychology instead addressed the full range of human functioning and focused on personal\\nfulfillment, valuing feelings over intellect, hedonism, a belief in human perfectibility, emphasis on the\\npresent, self-disclosure, self-actualization, positive regard, client centered therapy, and the hierarchy of\\nneeds. Again, these topics were in stark contrast to much of the work being done in the field of\\npsychology up to and at this time.\\nIn 1996, Martin Seligman became the president of the American Psychological Association (APA) and\\ncalled for a positive psychology or one that had a more positive conception of human potential and\\nnature. Building on Maslow and Roger’s work, he ushered in the scientific study of such topics as\\nhappiness, love, hope, optimism, life satisfaction, goal setting, leisure, and subjective well-being.\\nThough positive and humanistic psychology have similarities, their methodology was much different.\\nWhile humanistic psychology generally relied on qualitative methods, positive psychology utilizes a\\nquantitative approach and aims to help people make the most out of life’s setbacks, relate well to\\nothers, find fulfillment in creativity, and find lasting meaning and satisfaction\\n(https://www.positivepsychologyinstitute.com.au/what-is-positive-psychology).\\nSo, to understand what normal behavior is, do we look to positive psychology for an indication, or do we\\nfirst define abnormal behavior and then reverse engineer a definition of what normal is?

Possibly. The one truth is that no matter what\\nbehavior we display, if taken to the extreme, it can become disordered – whether trying to control\\nothers through social influence or helping people in an altruistic fashion. As such, we can consider\\nabnormal behavior to be a combination of personal distress, psychological dysfunction, deviance from\\nsocial norms, dangerousness to self and others, and costliness to society.\\n \\n1.1.2. How Do We Determine What Abnormal Behavior Is?\\nIn the previous section we showed that what we might consider normal behavior is difficult to define.\\nEqually challenging is understanding what abnormal behavior is, which may be surprising to you. A\\npublication which you will become intimately familiar with throughout this book, the American\\nPsychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th edition, Text\\nRevision (DSM-5-TR; 2022), states that, “Although no definition can capture all aspects of the range of\\ndisorders contained in DSM-5″ (pg. 13) certain aspects are required. These include:\\nDysfunction – Includes “clinically significant disturbance in an individual’s cognition, emotion\\nregulation, or behavior that reflects a dysfunction in the psychological, biological, or\\ndevelopmental processes underlying mental functioning” (pg. 14). Abnormal behavior, therefore,\\nhas the capacity to make well-being difficult to obtain and can be assessed by looking at an\\nindividual’s current performance and comparing it to what is expected in general or how the\\nperson has performed in the past. As such, a good employee who suddenly demonstrates poor\\nperformance may be experiencing an environmental demand leading to stress and ineffective\\ncoping mechanisms. Once the demand resolves itself, the person’s performance should return to\\nnormal according to this principle.\\nDistress – When the person experiences a disabling condition “in social, occupational, or other\\nimportant activities” (pg. 14). Distress can take the form of psychological or physical pain, or both\\nconcurrently. Alone though, distress is not sufficient enough to describe behavior as abnormal.\\nWhy is that? The loss of a loved one would cause even the most “normally” functioning individual\\npain. An athlete who experiences a career-ending injury would display distress as well. Suffering\\nis part of life and cannot be avoided. And some people who exhibit abnormal behavior are\\ngenerally positive while doing so.\\nDeviance – Closer examination of the word abnormal indicates a move away from what is normal,\\nor the mean (i.e., what would be considered average and in this case in relation to behavior), and\\nso is behavior that infrequently occurs (sort of an outlier in our data). Our culture, or the totality\\nof socially transmitted behaviors, customs, values, technology, attitudes, beliefs, art, and other\\nproducts that are particular to a group, determines what is normal. Thus, a person is said to be\\ndeviant when he or she fails to follow the stated and unstated rules of society, called social\\nnorms. Social norms change over time due to shifts in accepted values and expectations. For\\ninstance, homosexuality was taboo in the U.S. just a few decades ago, but today, it is generally\\naccepted. Likewise, PDAs, or public displays of affection, do not cause a second look by most\\npeople unlike the past when these outward expressions of love were restricted to the privacy of\\none’s own house or bedroom. In the U.S., crying is generally seen as a weakness for males.\\nHowever, if the behavior occurs in the context of a tragedy such as the Vegas mass shooting on\\nOctober 1, 2017, in which 58 people were killed and about 500 were wounded while attending the\\nRoute 91 Harvest Festival, then it is appropriate and understandable. Finally, consider that'),\n",

Genius is an example of behavior that is\\nnot the norm.\\nThough not part of the DSM conceptualization of what abnormal behavior is, many clinicians add\\ndangerousness to this list when behavior represents a threat to the safety of the person or others. It is\\nimportant to note that having a mental disorder does not imply a person is automatically dangerous.\\nThe depressed or anxious individual is often no more a threat than someone who is not depressed, and\\nas Hiday and Burns (2010) showed, dangerousness is more the exception than the rule.  Still, mental\\nhealth professionals have a duty to report to law enforcement when a mentally disordered individual\\nexpresses intent to harm another person or themselves. It is important to point out that people seen as\\ndangerous are also not automatically mentally ill.\\n \\n1.1.3. The Costs of Mental Illness\\nThis leads us to wonder what the cost of mental illness is to society. The National Alliance on Mental\\nIllness (NAMI) states that mental illness affects a person’s life which then ripples out to the family,\\ncommunity, and world. For instance, people with serious mental illness are at increased risk for\\ndiabetes, cancer, and cardiometabolic disease while 18% of those with a mental illness also have a\\nsubstance use disorder. Within the family, an estimated 8.4 million Americans provide care to an adult\\nwith an emotional or mental illness with caregivers spending about 32 hours a week providing unpaid\\ncare. At the community level 21% of the homeless also have a serious mental illness while 70% of youth\\nin the juvenile justice system have at least one mental health condition. And finally, depression is a\\nleading cause of disability worldwide and depression and anxiety disorders cost the global economy $1\\ntrillion each year in lost productivity (Source: NAMI, The Ripple Effect of Mental Illness infographic;\\nhttps://www.nami.org/Learn-More/Mental-Health-By-the-Numbers).\\nIn terms of worldwide impact, data from 2010 estimates $2.5 trillion in global costs, with $1.7 trillion\\nbeing indirect costs (i.e., invisible costs “associated with income losses due to mortality, disability, and\\ncare seeking, including lost production due to work absence or early retirement”) and the remainder\\nbeing direct (i.e., visible costs to include “medication, physician visits, psychotherapy sessions,\\nhospitalization,” etc.). It is now projected that mental illness costs will be around $16 trillion by 2030.\\nThe authors add, “It should be noted that these calculations did not include costs associated with\\nmental disorders from outside the healthcare system, such as legal costs caused by illicit drug abuse”\\n(Trautmann, Rehm, & Wittchen, 2016). The costs for mental illness have also been found to be greater\\nthan the combined costs of somatic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and respiratory disorders\\n(Whiteford et al., 2013).\\nChristensen et al. (2020) did a review of 143 cost-of-illness studies that covered 48 countries and\\nseveral types of mental illness. Their results showed that mental disorders are a substantial economic\\nburden for societies and that certain groups of mental disorders are more costly than others. At the\\nhigher cost end were developmental disorders to include autism spectrum disorders followed by\\nschizophrenia and intellectual disabilities. They write, “However, it is important to note that while\\ndisorders such as mood, neurotic and substance use disorders were less costly according to societal\\ncost per patient, these disorders are much more prevalent and thus would contribute substantially to\\nthe total national cost in a country.” And much like Trautmann, Rehm, & Wittchen (2016) other studies\\nshow that indirect costs are higher than direct costs (Jin & Mosweu, 2017; Chong et al., 2016).'),\n",

Defining Key Terms\\nOur discussion so far has concerned what normal and abnormal behavior is. We saw that the study of\\nnormal behavior falls under the providence of positive psychology. Similarly, the scientific study of\\nabnormal behavior, with the intent to be able to predict reliably, explain, diagnose, identify the causes\\nof, and treat maladaptive behavior, is what we refer to as abnormal psychology. Abnormal behavior\\ncan become pathological and has led to the scientific study of psychological disorders, or\\npsychopathology. From our previous discussion we can fashion the following definition of a\\npsychological or mental disorder: mental disorders are characterized by psychological dysfunction,\\nwhich causes physical and/or psychological distress or impaired functioning, and is not an expected\\nbehavior according to societal or cultural standards.\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nAbnormal behavior is a combination of personal distress, psychological dysfunction, deviance\\nfrom social norms, dangerousness to self and others, and costliness to society.\\nAbnormal psychology is the scientific study of abnormal behavior, with the intent to be able to\\npredict reliably, explain, diagnose, identify the causes of, and treat maladaptive behavior.\\nThe study of psychological disorders is called psychopathology.\\nMental disorders are characterized by psychological dysfunction, which causes physical and/or\\npsychological distress or impaired functioning, and is not an expected behavior according to\\nsocietal or cultural standards\\n \\nSection 1.1 Review Questions\\nWhat is the disease model and what problems existed with it?

Classification\\nClassification is not a foreign concept and as a student you have likely taken at least one biology class\\nthat discussed the taxonomic classification system of Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus,\\nand Species revolutionized by Swedish botanist, Carl Linnaeus.  You probably even learned a witty\\nmnemonic such as ‘King Phillip, Come Out For Goodness Sake’ to keep the order straight. The Library\\nof Congress uses classification to organize and arrange their book collections and includes such\\ncategories as B – Philosophy, Psychology, and Religion; H – Social Sciences; N – Fine Arts; Q – Science;\\nR – Medicine; and T – Technology.\\nSimply, classification is how we organize or categorize things. The second author’s wife has been\\nknown to color-code her Blu Ray collection by genre, movie title, and release date. It is useful for us to\\ndo the same with abnormal behavior, and classification provides us with a nomenclature, or naming\\nsystem, to structure our understanding of mental disorders in a meaningful way. Of course, we want to\\nlearn as much as we can about a given disorder so we can understand its cause, predict its future\\noccurrence, and develop ways to treat it.\\n \\n1.2.2. Determining Occurrence of a Disorder\\nEpidemiology is the scientific study of the frequency and causes of diseases and other health-related\\nstates in specific populations such as a school, neighborhood, a city, country, and the world.\\nPsychiatric or mental health epidemiology refers to the occurrence of mental disorders in a\\npopulation. In mental health facilities, we say that a patient presents with a specific problem, or the\\npresenting problem, and we give a clinical description of it, which includes information about the\\nthoughts, feelings, and behaviors that constitute that mental disorder. We also seek to gain information\\nabout the occurrence of the disorder, its cause, course, and treatment possibilities.\\nOccurrence can be investigated in several ways. First, prevalence is the percentage of people in a'),\n",

For instance, if 20 people out of 100 have bipolar disorder, then the\\nprevalence rate is 20%. Prevalence can be measured in several ways:\\nPoint prevalence indicates the proportion of a population that has the characteristic at a specific\\npoint in time. In other words, it is the number of active cases.\\nPeriod prevalence indicates the proportion of a population that has the characteristic at any\\npoint during a given period of time, typically the past year.\\nLifetime prevalence indicates the proportion of a population that has had the characteristic at\\nany time during their lives.\\nAccording to a 2020 infographic by the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), for U.S. adults, 1 in\\n5 experienced a mental illness, 1 in 20 had a serious mental illness, 1 in 15 experienced both a\\nsubstance use disorder and mental disorder, and over 12 million had serious thoughts of suicide (2020\\nMental Health By the Numbers: US Adults infographic). In terms of adolescents aged 12-17, in 2020 1\\nin 6 experienced a major depressive episode, 3 million had serious thoughts of suicide, and there was a\\n31% increase in mental health-related emergency department visits. Among U.S. young adults aged\\n18-25, 1 in 3 experienced a mental illness, 1 in 10 had a serious mental illness, and 3.8 had serious\\nthoughts of suicide (2020 Mental Health By the Numbers: Youth and Young Adults infographic). These\\nnumbers would represent period prevalence rates during the pandemic, and for the year 2020. In the,\\nYou are Not Alone infographic, NAMI reported the following 12-month prevalence rates for U.S. Adults:\\n19% having an anxiety disorder, 8% having depression, 4% having PTSD, 3% having bipolar disorder,\\nand 1% having schizophrenia.\\nSource: https://www.nami.org/mhstats\\n \\nIncidence indicates the number of new cases in a population over a specific period. This measure is\\nusually lower since it does not include existing cases as prevalence does. If you wish to know the\\nnumber of new cases of social phobia during the past year (going from say Aug 21, 2015 to Aug 20,\\n2016), you would only count cases that began during this time and ignore cases before the start date,\\neven if people are currently afflicted with the mental disorder. Incidence is often studied by medical and\\npublic health officials so that causes can be identified, and future cases prevented.\\nFinally, comorbidity describes when two or more mental disorders are occurring at the same time and\\nin the same person. The National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R) study conducted by the\\nNational Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and published in the June 6, 2005 issue of the Archives of\\nGeneral Psychiatry, sought to discover trends in prevalence, impairment, and service use during the\\n1990s. The first study, conducted from 1980 to 1985, surveyed 20,000 people from five different\\ngeographical regions in the U.S. A second study followed from 1990-1992 and was called the National\\nComorbidity Survey (NCS). The third study, the NCS-R, used a new nationally representative sample of\\nthe U.S. population, and found that 45% of those with one mental disorder met the diagnostic criteria\\nfor two or more disorders. The authors also found that the severity of mental illness, in terms of\\ndisability, is strongly related to comorbidity, and that substance use disorders often result from\\ndisorders such as anxiety and bipolar disorders. The implications of this are significant as services to\\ntreat substance abuse and mental disorders are often separate, despite the disorders appearing\\ntogether.'),\n",

Treatment is any procedure intended to modify abnormal behavior into\\nnormal behavior. The person suffering from the mental disorder seeks the assistance of a trained\\nprofessional to provide some degree of relief over a series of therapy sessions. The trained mental\\nhealth professional may prescribe medication or utilize psychotherapy to bring about this change.\\nTreatment may be sought from the primary care provider, in an outpatient facility, or through inpatient\\ncare or hospitalization at a mental hospital or psychiatric unit of a general hospital.

The collection process occurs through what we know as sensation – or detecting\\nphysical energy emitted or reflected by physical objects. Detection occurs courtesy of our eyes, ears,\\nnose, skin and mouth; or via vision, hearing, smell, touch, and taste, respectfully. Once collected, the\\ninformation is relayed to the brain through the neural impulse where it is processed and interpreted, or\\nmeaning is added to this raw sensory data which we call perception.\\nOne way meaning is added is by taking the information we just detected and using it to assign people to\\ncategories, or groups.

You might\\nthink of them as organized ways of making sense of experience. So, it is during our initial interaction\\nwith someone that we collect information about them, assign the person to a category for which we\\nhave a schema, and then use that to affect how we interact with them. First impressions, called the\\nprimacy effect, are important because even if we obtain new information that should override an\\nincorrect initial assessment, the initial impression is unlikely to change. We call this the perseverance\\neffect, or belief perseverance.\\nStereotypes are special types of schemas that are very simplistic, very strongly held, and not based on\\nfirsthand experience. They are heuristics, or mental shortcuts, that allow us to assess this collected\\ninformation very quickly. One piece of information, such as skin color, can be used to assign the person\\nto a schema for which we have a stereotype. This can affect how we think or feel about the person and\\nbehave toward them. Again, human beings tend to imply things about an individual solely due to a\\ndistinguishing feature and disregard anything inconsistent with the stereotype.\\nSocial identity theory (Tajfel, 1982; Turner, 1987) states that people categorize their social world into\\nmeaningfully simplistic representations of groups of people. These representations are then organized\\nas prototypes, or “fuzzy sets of a relatively limited number of category-defining features that not only\\ndefine one category but serve to distinguish it from other categories” (Foddy and Hogg, as cited in\\nFoddy et al., 1999). We construct in-groups and out-groups and categorize the self as an in-group\\nmember. The self is assimilated into the salient in-group prototype, which indicates what cognitions,\\naffect, and behavior we may exhibit. Stereotyping, out-group homogeneity, in-group/out-group bias,\\nnormative behavior, and conformity are all based on self-categorization.\\nHow so? Out-group homogeneity occurs when we see all members of an outside group as the same. This\\nleads to a tendency to show favoritism to, and exclude or hold a negative view of, members outside of,\\none’s immediate group, called the in-group/out-group bias. The negative view or set of beliefs about a\\ngroup of people is what we call prejudice, and this can result in acting in a way that is negative against\\na group of people, called discrimination. It should be noted that a person can be prejudicial without\\nbeing discriminatory since most people do not act on their attitudes toward others due to social norms\\nagainst such behavior. Likewise, a person or institution can be discriminatory without being prejudicial.\\nFor example, when a company requires that an applicant have a certain education level or be able to lift\\n80 pounds as part of typical job responsibilities. Individuals without a degree or ability to lift will be\\nremoved from consideration for the job, but this discriminatory act does not mean that the company has\\nnegative views of people without degrees or the inability to lift heavy weight. You might even hold a\\nnegative view of a specific group of people and not be aware of it. An attitude we are unaware of is\\ncalled an implicit attitude, which stands in contrast to explicit attitudes, which are the views within our\\nconscious awareness.\\nWe have spent quite a lot of space and time understanding how people gather information about the\\nworld and people around them, process this information, use it to make snap judgements about others,\\nform groups for which stereotypes may exist, and then potentially hold negative views of this group and\\nbehave negatively toward them as a result. Just one piece of information can be used to set this series of\\nmental events into motion. Outside of skin color, the label associated with having a mental disorder can\\nbe used. Stereotypes about people with a mental disorder can quickly and easily transform into\\nprejudice when people in a society determine the schema to be correct and form negative emotions and\\nevaluations of this group (Eagly & Chaiken, 1993). This, in turn, can lead to discriminatory practices\\nsuch as an employer refusing to hire, a landlord refusing to rent an apartment, or avoiding a romantic'),\n",

Stigma takes on\\nthree forms as described below:\\nPublic stigma – When members of a society endorse negative stereotypes of people with a mental\\ndisorder and discriminate against them. They might avoid them altogether, resulting in social\\nisolation. An example is when an employer intentionally does not hire a person because their\\nmental illness is discovered.\\nLabel avoidance –To avoid being labeled as “crazy” or “nuts” people needing care may avoid\\nseeking it altogether or stop care once started. Due to these labels, funding for mental health\\nservices could be restricted and instead, physical health services funded.\\nSelf-stigma – When people with mental illnesses internalize the negative stereotypes and\\nprejudice, and in turn, discriminate against themselves. They may experience shame, reduced\\nself-esteem, hopelessness, low self-efficacy, and a reduction in coping mechanisms. An obvious\\nconsequence of these potential outcomes is the why try effect, or the person saying ‘Why should I\\ntry and get that job? I am not worthy of it’ (Corrigan, Larson, & Rusch, 2009; Corrigan, et al.,\\n2016).\\nAnother form of stigma that is worth noting is that of courtesy stigma or when stigma affects people\\nassociated with a person who has a mental disorder. Karnieli-Miller et al. (2013) found that families of\\nthe afflicted were often blamed, rejected, or devalued when others learned that a family member had a\\nserious mental illness (SMI). Due to this, they felt hurt and betrayed, and an important source of social\\nsupport during a difficult time had disappeared, resulting in greater levels of stress. To cope, some\\nfamilies concealed their relative’s illness, and some parents struggled to decide whether it was their\\nplace to disclose their child’s condition. Others fought with the issue of confronting the stigma through\\nattempts at education versus just ignoring it due to not having enough energy or desiring to maintain\\npersonal boundaries. There was also a need to understand the responses of others and to attribute it to\\na lack of knowledge, experience, and/or media coverage. In some cases, the reappraisal allowed family\\nmembers to feel compassion for others rather than feeling put down or blamed. The authors concluded\\nthat each family “develops its own coping strategies which vary according to its personal experiences,\\nvalues, and extent of other commitments” and that “coping strategies families employ change over-\\ntime.”\\nOther effects of stigma include experiencing work-related discrimination resulting in higher levels of\\nself-stigma and stress (Rusch et al., 2014), higher rates of suicide especially when treatment is not\\navailable (Rusch, Zlati, Black, and Thornicroft, 2014; Rihmer & Kiss, 2002), and a decreased likelihood\\nof future help-seeking intention (Lally et al., 2013). The results of the latter study also showed that\\npersonal contact with someone with a history of mental illness led to a decreased likelihood of seeking\\nhelp. This is important because 48% of the university sample stated that they needed help for an\\nemotional or mental health issue during the past year but did not seek help. Similar results have been\\nreported in other studies (Eisenberg, Downs, Golberstein, & Zivin, 2009). It is also important to point\\nout that social distance, a result of stigma, has also been shown to increase throughout the life span,\\nsuggesting that anti-stigma campaigns should focus on older people primarily (Schomerus, et al., 2015).\\nOne potentially disturbing trend is that mental health professionals have been shown to hold negative\\nattitudes toward the people they serve. Hansson et al. (2011) found that staff members at an outpatient'),\n",

Attitudes were stronger when staff treated patients with a psychosis or in\\ninpatient settings. In a similar study,\\nMartensson, Jacobsson, and Engstrom (2014) found that staff had more positive attitudes towards\\npersons with mental illness if their knowledge of such disorders was less stigmatized; their workplaces\\nwere in the county council where they were more likely to encounter patients who recover and return to\\nnormal life in society, rather than in municipalities where patients have long-term and recurrent mental\\nillness; and they have or had one close friend with mental health issues.\\nTo help deal with stigma in the mental health community, Papish et al. (2013) investigated the effect of\\na one-time contact-based educational intervention compared to a four-week mandatory psychiatry\\ncourse on the stigma of mental illness among medical students at the University of Calgary. The\\ncurriculum included two methods requiring contact with people diagnosed with a mental disorder:\\npatient presentations, or two one-hour oral presentations in which patients shared their story of having\\na mental illness, and “clinical correlations” in which a psychiatrist mentored students while they\\ninteracted with patients in either inpatient or outpatient settings. Results showed that medical students\\nheld a stigma towards mental illness and that comprehensive medical education reduced this stigma. As\\nthe authors stated, “These results suggest that it is possible to create an environment in which medical\\nstudent attitudes towards mental illness can be shifted in a positive direction.” That said, the level of\\nstigma was still higher for mental illness than it was for the stigmatized physical illness, type 2 diabetes\\nmellitus.\\nWhat might happen if mental illness is presented as a treatable condition? McGinty, Goldman,\\nPescosolido, and Barry (2015) found that portraying schizophrenia, depression, and heroin addiction as\\nuntreated and symptomatic increased negative public attitudes towards people with these conditions.\\nConversely, when the same people were portrayed as successfully treated, the desire for social distance\\nwas reduced, there was less willingness to discriminate against them, and belief in treatment\\neffectiveness increased among the public.\\nSelf-stigma has also been shown to affect self-esteem, which then affects hope, which then affects the\\nquality of life among people with severe mental illness. As such, hope should play a central role in\\nrecovery (Mashiach-Eizenberg et al., 2013). Narrative Enhancement and Cognitive Therapy (NECT) is\\nan intervention designed to reduce internalized stigma and targets both hope and self-esteem (Yanos et\\nal., 2011). The intervention replaces stigmatizing myths with facts about illness and recovery, which\\nleads to hopefulness and higher levels of self-esteem in clients. This may then reduce susceptibility to\\ninternalized stigma.\\nStigma leads to health inequities (Hatzenbuehler, Phelan, & Link, 2013), prompting calls for stigma\\nchange. Targeting stigma involves two different agendas: The services agenda attempts to remove\\nstigma so people can seek mental health services, and the rights agenda tries to replace discrimination\\nthat “robs people of rightful opportunities with affirming attitudes and behavior” (Corrigan, 2016). The\\nformer is successful when there is evidence that people with mental illness are seeking services more or\\nbecoming better engaged. The latter is successful when there is an increase in the number of people\\nwith mental illnesses in the workforce who are receiving reasonable accommodations. The federal\\ngovernment has tackled this issue with landmark legislation such as the Patient Protection and\\nAffordable Care Act of 2010, Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008, and the Americans'),\n",

In this section, we\\nwill examine how past societies viewed and dealt with mental illness.\\n \\n1.4.1. Prehistoric and Ancient Beliefs\\nPrehistoric cultures often held a supernatural view of abnormal behavior and saw it as the work of evil\\nspirits, demons, gods, or witches who took control of the person. This form of demonic possession often\\noccurred when the person engaged in behavior contrary to the religious teachings of the time.\\nTreatment by cave dwellers included a technique called trephination, in which a stone instrument\\nknown as a trephine was used to remove part of the skull, creating an opening. Through it, the evil\\nspirits could escape, thereby ending the person’s mental affliction and returning them to normal\\nbehavior. Early Greek, Hebrew, Egyptian, and Chinese cultures used a treatment method called\\nexorcism in which evil spirts were cast out through prayer, magic, flogging, starvation, having the\\nperson ingest horrible tasting drinks, or noisemaking.\\n \\n1.4.2. Greco-Roman Thought\\nRejecting the idea of demonic possession, Greek physician Hippocrates (460-377 B.C.) said that mental\\ndisorders were akin to physical ailments and had natural causes. Specifically, they arose from brain\\npathology, or head trauma/brain dysfunction or disease, and were also affected by heredity.\\nHippocrates classified mental disorders into three main categories – melancholia, mania, and phrenitis\\n(brain fever) – and gave detailed clinical descriptions of each. He also described four main fluids or\\nhumors that directed normal brain functioning and personality – blood which arose in the heart, black\\nbile arising in the spleen, yellow bile or choler from the liver, and phlegm from the brain. Mental\\ndisorders occurred when the humors were in a state of imbalance such as an excess of yellow bile\\ncausing frenzy and too much black bile causing melancholia or depression. Hippocrates believed mental\\nillnesses could be treated as any other disorder and focused on the underlying pathology.\\nAlso noteworthy was the Greek philosopher Plato (429-347 B.C.), who said that the mentally ill were not\\nresponsible for their actions and should not be punished. It was the responsibility of the community and\\ntheir families to care for them. The Greek physician Galen (A.D. 129-199) said mental disorders had\\neither physical or psychological causes, including fear, shock, alcoholism, head injuries, adolescence,\\nand changes in menstruation.\\nIn Rome, physician Asclepiades (124-40 BC) and philosopher Cicero (106-43 BC) rejected Hippocrates’\\nidea of the four humors and instead stated that melancholy arises from grief, fear, and rage; not excess\\nblack bile. Roman physicians treated mental disorders with massage or warm baths, the hope being that\\ntheir patients would be as comfortable as they could be. They practiced the concept of contrariis\\ncontrarius, meaning opposite by opposite, and introduced contrasting stimuli to bring about balance in\\nthe physical and mental domains. An example would be consuming a cold drink while in a warm bath.'),\n",

The Middle Ages – 500 AD to 1500 AD\\nThe progress made during the time of the Greeks and Romans was quickly reversed during the Middle\\nAges with the increase in power of the Church and the fall of the Roman Empire. Mental illness was yet\\nagain explained as possession by the Devil and methods such as exorcism, flogging, prayer, the\\ntouching of relics, chanting, visiting holy sites, and holy water were used to rid the person of demonic\\ninfluence. In extreme cases, the afflicted were exposed to confinement, beatings, and even execution.\\nScientific and medical explanations, such as those proposed by Hippocrates, were discarded.\\nGroup hysteria, or mass madness, was also seen when large numbers of people displayed similar\\nsymptoms and false beliefs. This included the belief that one was possessed by wolves or other animals\\nand imitated their behavior, called lycanthropy, and a mania in which large numbers of people had an\\nuncontrollable desire to dance and jump, called tarantism. The latter was believed to have been caused\\nby the bite of the wolf spider, now called the tarantula, and spread quickly from Italy to Germany and\\nother parts of Europe where it was called Saint Vitus’s dance.\\nPerhaps the return to supernatural explanations during the Middle Ages makes sense given events of\\nthe time. The black death (bubonic plague) killed up to a third, or according to other estimates almost\\nhalf, of the population. Famine, war, social oppression, and pestilence were also factors. The constant\\npresence of death led to an epidemic of depression and fear. Near the end of the Middle Ages, mystical\\nexplanations for mental illness began to lose favor, and government officials regained some of their lost\\npower over nonreligious activities. Science and medicine were again called upon to explain\\npsychopathology.\\n \\n1.4.4. The Renaissance – 14th to 16th centuries\\nThe most noteworthy development in the realm of philosophy during the Renaissance was the rise of\\nhumanism, or the worldview that emphasizes human welfare and the uniqueness of the individual. This\\nperspective helped continue the decline of supernatural views of mental illness. In the mid to late\\n1500s, German physician Johann Weyer (1515-1588) published his book, On the Deceits of the Demons,\\nthat rebutted the Church’s witch-hunting handbook, the Malleus Maleficarum, and argued that many\\naccused of being witches and subsequently imprisoned, tortured, and/or burned at the stake, were\\nmentally disturbed and not possessed by demons or the Devil himself. He believed that like the body,\\nthe mind was susceptible to illness. Not surprisingly, the book was vehemently protested and banned by\\nthe Church. It should be noted that these types of acts occurred not only in Europe, but also in the\\nUnited States. The most famous example, the Salem Witch Trials of 1692, resulted in more than 200\\npeople accused of practicing witchcraft and 20 deaths.\\nThe number of asylums, or places of refuge for the mentally ill where they could receive care, began to\\nrise during the 16th century as the government realized there were far too many people afflicted with\\nmental illness to be left in private homes. Hospitals and monasteries were converted into asylums.\\nThough the intent was benign in the beginning, as the facilities overcrowded, the patients came to be\\ntreated more like animals than people. In 1547, the Bethlem Hospital opened in London with the sole\\npurpose of confining those with mental disorders. Patients were chained up, placed on public display,\\nand often heard crying out in pain. The asylum became a tourist attraction, with sightseers paying a\\npenny to view the more violent patients, and soon was called “Bedlam” by local people; a term that\\ntoday means “a state of uproar and confusion” (https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bedlam).'),\n",

Reform Movement – 18th to 19th centuries\\nThe rise of the moral treatment movement occurred in Europe in the late 18th century and then in\\nthe United States in the early 19th century. The earliest proponent was Francis Pinel (1745-1826), the\\nsuperintendent of la Bicetre, a hospital for mentally ill men in Paris. Pinel stressed respectful treatment\\nand moral guidance for the mentally ill while considering their individual, social, and occupational\\nneeds. Arguing that the mentally ill were sick people, Pinel ordered that chains be removed, outside\\nexercise be allowed, sunny and well-ventilated rooms replace dungeons, and patients be extended\\nkindness and support. This approach led to considerable improvement for many of the patients, so much\\nso, that several were released.\\nFollowing Pinel’s lead, William Tuke (1732-1822), a Quaker tea merchant, established a pleasant rural\\nestate called the York Retreat. The Quakers believed that all people should be accepted for who they\\nare and treated kindly. At the retreat, patients could work, rest, talk out their problems, and pray (Raad\\n& Makari, 2010). The work of Tuke and others led to the passage of the Country Asylums Act of 1845,\\nwhich required that every county provide asylum to the mentally ill. This sentiment extended to English\\ncolonies such as Canada, India, Australia, and the West Indies as word of the maltreatment of patients\\nat a facility in Kingston, Jamaica spread, leading to an audit of colonial facilities and their policies.\\nReform in the United States started with the figure largely considered to be the father of American\\npsychiatry, Benjamin Rush (1745-1813). Rush advocated for the humane treatment of the mentally ill,\\nshowing them respect, and even giving them small gifts from time to time.  Despite this, his practice\\nincluded treatments such as bloodletting and purgatives, the invention of the “tranquilizing chair,” and\\nreliance on astrology, showing that even he could not escape from the beliefs of the time.\\nDue to the rise of the moral treatment movement in both Europe and the United States, asylums\\nbecame habitable places where those afflicted with mental illness could recover. Regrettably, its\\nsuccess was responsible for its decline. The number of mental hospitals greatly increased, leading to\\nstaffing shortages and a lack of funds to support them. Though treating patients humanely was a noble\\nendeavor, it did not work for some patients and other treatments were needed, though they had not\\nbeen developed yet. Staff recognized that the approach worked best when the facility had 200 or fewer\\npatients, but waves of immigrants arriving in the U.S. after the Civil War overwhelmed the facilities,\\nand patient counts soared to 1,000 or more. Prejudice against the new arrivals led to discriminatory\\npractices in which immigrants were not afforded the same moral treatments as native citizens, even\\nwhen the resources were available to treat them.\\nThe moral treatment movement also fell due to the rise of the mental hygiene movement, which\\nfocused on the physical well-being of patients. Its leading proponent in the United States was Dorothea\\nDix (1802-1887), a New Englander who observed the deplorable conditions suffered by the mentally ill\\nwhile teaching Sunday school to female prisoners. Over the next 40 years, from 1841 to 1881, she\\nmotivated people and state legislators to do something about this injustice and raised millions of dollars\\nto build over 30 more appropriate mental hospitals and improve others. Her efforts even extended\\nbeyond the U.S. to Canada and Scotland.\\nFinally, in 1908 Clifford Beers (1876-1943) published his book, A Mind that Found Itself, in which he\\ndescribed his struggle with bipolar disorder and the “cruel and inhumane treatment people with mental\\nillnesses received. He witnessed and experienced horrific abuse at the hands of his caretakers. At one'),\n",

Biological or Somatogenic Perspective. Recall that Greek physicians Hippocrates and\\nGalen said that mental disorders were akin to physical disorders and had natural causes. Though the\\nidea fell into oblivion for several centuries, it re-emerged in the late 19th century for two reasons.  First,\\nGerman psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin (1856-1926) discovered that symptoms occurred regularly in\\nclusters, which he called syndromes. These syndromes represented a unique mental disorder with a\\ndistinct cause, course, and prognosis. In 1883 he published his textbook, Compendium der Psychiatrie\\n(Textbook of Psychiatry), and described a system for classifying mental disorders that became the basis\\nof the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)\\nthat is currently in its 5th edition Text Revision (published in 2022).\\nSecondly, in 1825, the behavioral and cognitive symptoms of advanced syphilis were identified to\\ninclude a belief that everyone is plotting against you or that you are God (a delusion of grandeur), and\\nwere termed general paresis by French physician A.L.J. Bayle. In 1897, Viennese psychiatrist Richard\\nvon Krafft-Ebbing injected patients suffering from general paresis with matter from syphilis spores and\\nnoted that none of the patients developed symptoms of syphilis, indicating they must have been\\npreviously exposed and were now immune. This led to the conclusion that syphilis was the cause of the\\ngeneral paresis. In 1906, August von Wassermann developed a blood test for syphilis, and in 1917 a\\ncure was found. Julius von Wagner-Jauregg noticed that patients with general paresis who contracted\\nmalaria recovered from their symptoms. To test this hypothesis, he injected nine patients with blood\\nfrom a soldier afflicted with malaria. Three of the patients fully recovered while three others showed\\ngreat improvement in their paretic symptoms. The high fever caused by malaria burned out the syphilis\\nbacteria. Hospitals in the United States began incorporating this new cure for paresis into their\\ntreatment approach by 1925.'),\n",

Grey. Appointed as superintendent of\\nthe Utica State Hospital in New York, Grey asserted that insanity always had a physical cause. As such,\\nthe mentally ill should be seen as physically ill and treated with rest, proper room temperature and\\nventilation, and a nutritive diet.\\nThe 1930s also saw the use of electric shock as a treatment method, which was stumbled upon\\naccidentally by Benjamin Franklin while experimenting with electricity in the early 18th century. He\\nnoticed that after suffering a severe shock his memories had changed, and in published work, he\\nsuggested physicians study electric shock as a treatment for melancholia.\\n            1.4.6.2. Psychological or Psychogenic Perspective. The psychological or psychogenic\\nperspective states that emotional or psychological factors are the cause of mental disorders and\\nrepresented a challenge to the biological perspective. This perspective had a long history but did not\\ngain favor until the work of Viennese physician Franz Anton Mesmer (1734-1815). Influenced heavily by\\nNewton’s theory of gravity, he believed that the planets also affected the human body through the force\\nof animal magnetism and that all people had a universal magnetic fluid that determined how healthy\\nthey were. He demonstrated the usefulness of his approach when he cured Franzl Oesterline, a 27-year-\\nold woman suffering from what he described as a convulsive malady. Mesmer used a magnet to disrupt\\nthe gravitational tides that were affecting his patient and produced a sensation of the magnetic fluid\\ndraining from her body. This procedure removed the illness from her body and provided a near-\\ninstantaneous recovery. In reality, the patient was placed in a trancelike state which made her highly\\nsuggestible. With other patients, Mesmer would have them sit in a darkened room filled with soothing\\nmusic, into which he would enter dressed in a colorful robe and pass from person to person touching\\nthe afflicted area of their body with his hand or a rod/wand. He successfully cured deafness, paralysis,\\nloss of bodily feeling, convulsions, menstrual difficulties, and blindness.\\nHis approach gained him celebrity status as he demonstrated it at the courts of English nobility.\\nHowever, the medical community was hardly impressed. A royal commission was formed to investigate\\nhis technique but could not find any proof for his theory of animal magnetism. Though he was able to\\ncure patients when they touched his “magnetized” tree, the result was the same when “non-\\nmagnetized” trees were touched. As such, Mesmer was deemed a charlatan and forced to leave Paris.\\nHis technique was called mesmerism, better known today as hypnosis.\\nThe psychological perspective gained popularity after two physicians practicing in the city of Nancy in\\nFrance discovered that they could induce the symptoms of hysteria in perfectly healthy patients through\\nhypnosis and then remove the symptoms in the same way. The work of Hippolyte-Marie Bernheim\\n(1840-1919) and Ambroise-Auguste Liebault (1823-1904) came to be part of what was called the Nancy\\nSchool and showed that hysteria was nothing more than a form of self-hypnosis. In Paris, this view was\\nchallenged by Jean Charcot (1825-1893), who stated that hysteria was caused by degenerative brain\\nchanges, reflecting the biological perspective. He was proven wrong and eventually turned to their way\\nof thinking.\\nThe use of hypnosis to treat hysteria was also carried out by fellow Frenchman Pierre Janet\\n(1859-1947), and student of Charcot, who believed that hysteria had psychological, not biological\\ncauses. Namely, these included unconscious forces, fixed ideas, and memory impairments. In Vienna,\\nJosef Breuer (1842-1925) induced hypnosis and had patients speak freely about past events that upset\\nthem. Upon waking, he discovered that patients sometimes were free of their symptoms of hysteria.\\nSuccess was even greater when patients not only recalled forgotten memories but also relived them'),\n",

Current Views/Trends\\n            1.4.7.1. Mental illness today. An article published by the Harvard Medical School in March\\n2014 called “The Prevalence and Treatment of Mental Illness Today” presented the results of the\\nNational Comorbidity Study Replication of 2001-2003, which included a sample of more than 9,000\\nadults. The results showed that nearly 46% of the participants had a psychiatric disorder at some time\\nin their lives. The most commonly reported disorders were:\\nMajor depression – 17%\\nAlcohol abuse – 13%\\nSocial anxiety disorder – 12%\\nConduct disorder – 9.5%\\nAlso of interest was that women were more likely to have had anxiety and mood disorders while men\\nshowed higher rates of impulse control disorders. Comorbid anxiety and mood disorders were common,\\nand 28% reported having more than one co-occurring disorder (Kessler, Berglund, et al., 2005; Kessler,\\nChiu, et al., 2005; Kessler, Demler, et al., 2005).\\nAbout 80% of the sample reported seeking treatment for their disorder, but with as much as a 10-year\\ngap after symptoms first appeared. Women were more likely than men to seek help while whites were\\nmore likely than African and Hispanic Americans (Wang, Berglund, et al., 2005; Wang, Lane, et al.,\\n2005). Care was sought primarily from family doctors, nurses, and other general practitioners (23%),\\nfollowed by social workers and psychologists (16%), psychiatrists (12%), counselors or spiritual advisers\\n(8%), and complementary and alternative medicine providers (CAMs; 7%).\\nIn terms of the quality of the care, the article states:\\nMost of this treatment was inadequate, at least by the standards applied in the survey. The researchers\\ndefined minimum adequacy as a suitable medication at a suitable dose for two months, along with at\\nleast four visits to a physician; or else eight visits to any licensed mental health professional. By that\\ndefinition, only 33% of people with a psychiatric disorder were treated adequately, and only 13% of\\nthose who saw general medical practitioners.\\nIn comparison to the original study conducted from 1991-1992, the use of mental health services has\\nincreased over 50% during this decade. This may be attributed to treatment becoming more widespread\\nand increased attempts to educate the public about mental illness. Stigma, discussed in Section 1.3, has\\nreduced over time, diagnosis is more effective, community outreach programs have increased, and most\\nimportantly, general practitioners have been more willing to prescribe psychoactive medications which\\nthemselves are more readily available now. The article concludes, “Survey researchers also suggest that'),\n",

Use of psychiatric drugs and deinstitutionalization. Beginning in the 1950s,\\npsychiatric or psychotropic drugs were used for the treatment of mental illness and made an immediate\\nimpact. Though drugs alone cannot cure mental illness, they can improve symptoms and increase the\\neffectiveness of treatments such as psychotherapy. Classes of psychiatric drugs include anti-\\ndepressants used to treat depression and anxiety, mood-stabilizing medications to treat bipolar\\ndisorder, anti-psychotic drugs to treat schizophrenia, and anti-anxiety drugs to treat generalized anxiety\\ndisorder or panic disorder\\nFrank (2006) found that by 1996, psychotropic drugs were used in 77% of mental health cases and\\nspending on these drugs grew from $2.8 billion in 1987 to about $18 billion in 2001 (Coffey et al., 2000;\\nMark et al., 2005), representing over a sixfold increase. The largest classes of psychotropic drugs are\\nanti-psychotics and anti-depressants, followed closely by anti-anxiety medications. Frank, Conti, and\\nGoldman (2005) point out, “The expansion of insurance coverage for prescription drugs, the\\nintroduction and diffusion of managed behavioral health care techniques, and the conduct of the\\npharmaceutical industry in promoting their products all have influenced how psychotropic drugs are\\nused and how much is spent on them.” Is it possible then that we are overprescribing these mediations?\\nDavey (2014) provides ten reasons why this may be so, including leading suffers from believing that\\nrecovery is in their hands but instead in the hands of their doctors; increased risk of relapse; drug\\ncompanies causing the “medicalization of perfectly normal emotional processes, such as bereavement”\\nto ensure their survival; side effects; and a failure to change the way the person thinks or the\\nsocioeconomic environments that may be the cause of the disorder. For more on this article, please see:\\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/why-we-worry/201401/overprescribing-drugs-treat-mental-healt\\nh-problems. Smith (2012) echoed similar sentiments in an article on inappropriate prescribing. He cites\\nthe approval of Prozac by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1987 as when the issue began and\\nthe overmedication/overdiagnosis of children with ADHD as a more recent example.\\nA result of the use of psychiatric drugs was deinstitutionalization, or the release of patients from\\nmental health facilities. This shifted resources from inpatient to outpatient care and placed the spotlight\\nback on the biological or somatogenic perspective.  When people with severe mental illness do need\\ninpatient care, it is typically in the form of short-term hospitalization.\\n            1.4.7.3. Managed health care. Managed health care is a term used to describe a type of\\nhealth insurance in which the insurance company determines the cost of services, possible providers,\\nand the number of visits a subscriber can have within a year. This is regulated through contracts with\\nproviders and medical facilities. The plans pay the providers directly, so subscribers do not have to pay\\nout-of-pocket or complete claim forms, though most require co-pays paid directly to the provider at the\\ntime of service. Exactly how much the plan costs depends on how flexible the subscriber wants it to be;\\nthe more flexibility, the higher the cost. Managed health care takes three forms:\\nHealth Maintenance Organizations (HMO) – Typically only pay for care within the network. The\\nsubscriber chooses a primary care physician (PCP) who coordinates most of their care. The PCP\\nrefers the subscriber to specialists or other health care providers as is necessary. This is the most'),\n",

This system was\\ndeveloped in the 1980s to combat the rising cost of mental health care and took responsibility away\\nfrom single practitioners or small groups who could charge what they felt was appropriate. The actual\\nimpact of managed care on mental health services is still questionable at best.\\n            1.4.7.4. Multicultural psychology. As our society becomes increasingly diverse, medical\\npractitioners and psychologists alike must take into account the patient’s gender, age, race, ethnicity,\\nsocioeconomic (SES) status, and culture and how these factors shape the individual’s thoughts, feelings,\\nand behaviors. Additionally, we need to understand how the various groups, whether defined by race,\\nculture, or gender, differ from one another. This approach is called multicultural psychology.\\nIn August 2002, the American Psychological Association’s (APA) Council of Representatives put forth six\\nguidelines based on the understanding that “race and ethnicity can impact psychological practice and\\ninterventions at all levels” and the need for respect and inclusiveness. They further state, “psychologists\\nare in a position to provide leadership as agents of prosocial change, advocacy, and social justice,\\nthereby promoting societal understanding, affirmation, and appreciation of multiculturalism against the\\ndamaging effects of individual, institutional, and societal racism, prejudice, and all forms of oppression\\nbased on stereotyping and discrimination.” The guidelines from the 2002 document are as follows:\\n“Guideline #1: Psychologists are encouraged to recognize that, as cultural beings, they may hold\\nattitudes and beliefs that can detrimentally influence their perceptions of and interactions with\\nindividuals who are ethnically and racially different from themselves.\\nGuideline #2: Psychologists are encouraged to recognize the importance of multicultural\\nsensitivity/responsiveness, knowledge, and understanding about ethnically and racially different\\nindividuals.\\nGuideline #3: As educators, psychologists are encouraged to employ the constructs of\\nmulticulturalism and diversity in psychological education.\\nGuideline #4: Culturally sensitive psychological researchers are encouraged to recognize the\\nimportance of conducting culture–centered and ethical psychological research among persons\\nfrom ethnic, linguistic, and racial minority backgrounds.\\nGuideline #5: Psychologists strive to apply culturally-appropriate skills in clinical and other\\napplied psychological practices.\\nGuideline #6: Psychologists are encouraged to use organizational change processes to support\\nculturally informed organizational (policy) development and practices.”\\nSource: https://apa.org/pi/oema/resources/policy/multicultural-guidelines.aspx\\n \\nThis type of sensitivity training is vital because bias based on ethnicity, race, and culture has been\\nfound in the diagnosis and treatment of autism (Harrison et al., 2017; Burkett, 2015), borderline'),\n",

Women were\\noffered an appointment time in their preferred time range more than men were, though average\\nappointment offer rates were similar between genders (Kugelmass, 2016). These findings collectively\\nshow that though we are becoming more culturally sensitive, we have a lot more work to do.\\n            1.4.7.5. Prescription rights for psychologists. To reduce inappropriate prescribing as\\ndescribed in 1.4.7.2, it has been proposed to allow appropriately trained psychologists the right to\\nprescribe. Psychologists are more likely to utilize both therapy and medication, and so can make the\\nbest choice for their patient. The right has already been granted in New Mexico, Louisiana, Guam, the\\nmilitary, the Indian Health Services, and the U.S. Public Health Services. Measures in other states\\n“have been opposed by the American Medical Association and American Psychiatric Association over\\nconcerns that inadequate training of psychologists could jeopardize patient safety. Supporters of\\nprescriptive authority for psychologists are quick to point out that there is no evidence to support these\\nconcerns” (Smith, 2012).\\n            1.4.7.6. Prevention science. As a society, we used to wait for a mental or physical health\\nissue to emerge, then scramble to treat it. More recently, medicine and science has taken a prevention\\nstance, identifying the factors that cause specific mental health issues and implementing interventions\\nto stop them from happening, or at least minimize their deleterious effects. Our focus has shifted from\\nindividuals to the population. Mental health promotion programs have been instituted with success in\\nschools (Shoshani & Steinmetz, 2014; Weare & Nind, 2011; Berkowitz & Beer, 2007), in the workplace\\n(Czabała, Charzyńska,  & Mroziak, B., 2011), with undergraduate and graduate students (Conley et al.,\\n2017; Bettis et al., 2016), in relation to bullying (Bradshaw, 2015), and with the elderly (Forsman et al.,\\n2011). Many researchers believe it is the ideal time to move from knowledge to action and to expand\\npublic mental health initiatives (Wahlbeck, 2015). The growth of positive psychology in the late 1990s\\nhas further propelled this movement forward. For more on positive psychology, please see Section\\n1.1.1.\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nSome of the earliest views of mental illness saw it as the work of evil spirts, demons, gods, or\\nwitches who took control of the person, and in the Middle Ages it was seen as possession by the\\nDevil and methods such as exorcism, flogging, prayer, the touching of relics, chanting, visiting\\nholy sites, and holy water were used to rid the person of demonic influence.\\nDuring the Renaissance, humanism was on the rise which emphasized human welfare and the\\nuniqueness of the individual and led to an increase in the number of asylums as places of refuge'),\n",

It is safe\\nto say that most people outside of our discipline or a sister science would be surprised to learn that\\npsychology utilizes the scientific method at all. That may be even truer of clinical psychology, especially\\nin light of the plethora of self-help books found at any bookstore. But yes, the treatment methods used\\nby mental health professionals are based on empirical research and the scientific method.\\nAs a starting point, we should expand on what the scientific method is.\\nThe scientific method is a systematic method for gathering knowledge about the world around us.\\nThe keyword here is systematic, meaning there is a set way to use it. What is that way? Well, depending\\non what source you look at, it can include a varying number of steps. I like to use the following:\\n \\nTable 1.1: The Steps of the Scientific Method\\nStep Name Description\\n0\\nAsk questions and\\nbe willing to\\nwonder.\\nTo study the world around us, you have to wonder about it. This inquisitive\\nnature is the hallmark of critical thinking —our ability to assess claims\\nmade by others and make objective judgments that are independent of\\nemotion and anecdote and based on hard evidence —and a requirement to\\nbe a scientist.\\n1\\nGenerate a\\nresearch question\\nor identify a\\nproblem to\\ninvestigate.\\nThrough our wonderment about the world around us and why events occur\\nas they do, we begin to ask questions that require further investigation to\\narrive at an answer. This investigation usually starts with a literature\\nreview, or when we conduct a literature search through our university\\nlibrary or a search engine such as Google Scholar to see what questions\\nhave been investigated already and what answers have been found, so that\\nwe can identify gaps or holes in this body of work.\\n2\\nAttempt to explain\\nthe phenomena we\\nwish to study.\\nWe now attempt to formulate an explanation of why the event occurs as it\\ndoes. This systematic explanation of a phenomenon is a theory and our\\nspecific, testable prediction is the hypothesis. We will know if our theory is\\ncorrect because we have formulated a hypothesis that we can now test.\\n \\n3 Test the\\nhypothesis.\\nIt goes without saying that if we cannot test our hypothesis, then we cannot\\nshow whether our prediction is correct or not. Our plan of action of how we\\nwill go about testing the hypothesis is called our research design. In the\\nplanning stage, we will select the appropriate research method to answer\\nour question/test our hypothesis.'),\n",

In our effort to stop a child\\nfrom engaging in self-injurious behavior that could cause substantial harm or\\neven death, we might overstate the success of our treatment method.\\n6\\nCommunicate our\\nfindings to the\\nbroader scientific\\ncommunity.\\nOnce we have decided on whether our hypothesis was correct or not, we\\nneed to share this information with others so that they might comment\\ncritically on our methodology, statistical analyses, and conclusions. Sharing\\nalso allows for replication or repeating the study to confirm its results.\\nCommunication occurs via scientific journals, conferences, or newsletters\\nreleased by many of the organizations mentioned in Module 1.6.\\n \\nScience has at its root three cardinal features that we will see play out time and time again throughout\\nthis book. They are:\\nObservation – To know about the world around us, we have to be able to see it firsthand. When a1.\\nmental disorder afflicts an individual, we can see it through their overt behavior. An individual\\nwith depression may withdraw from activities he/she enjoys, those with social anxiety disorder\\nwill avoid social situations, people with schizophrenia may express concern over being watched by\\nthe government, and individuals with dependent personality disorder may leave major decisions\\nto trusted companions. In these examples and numerous others, the behaviors that lead us to a\\ndiagnosis of a specific disorder can easily be observed by the clinician, the patient, and/or family\\nand friends.\\nExperimentation – To be able to make causal or cause and effect statements, we must isolate2.\\nvariables. We must manipulate one variable and see the effect of doing so on another variable.\\nLet’s say we want to know if a new treatment for bipolar disorder is as effective as existing\\ntreatments, or more importantly, better. We could design a study with three groups of bipolar\\npatients. One group would receive no treatment and serve as a control group. A second group\\nwould receive an existing and proven treatment and would also be considered a control group.\\nFinally, the third group would receive the new treatment and be the experimental group. What we\\nare manipulating is what treatment the groups get – no treatment, the older treatment, and the\\nnewer treatment. The first two groups serve as controls since we already know what to expect\\nfrom their results. There should be no change in bipolar disorder symptoms in the no-treatment\\ngroup, a general reduction in symptoms for the older treatment group, and the same or better\\nperformance for the newer treatment group. As long as patients in the newer treatment group do\\nnot perform worse than their older treatment counterparts, we can say the new drug is a success.'),\n",

Does it really offer any added benefit? In terms of a reduction of symptoms,\\nmaybe not, but it could cost less money than the older drug and that would be of value to patients.\\nMeasurement – How do we know that the new drug has worked? Simply, we can measure the3.\\nperson’s bipolar disorder symptoms before any treatment was implemented, and then again once\\nthe treatment has run its course.  This pre-post test design is typical in drug studies.\\n \\n1.5.2. Research Methods\\nStep 3 called on the scientist to test his or her hypothesis. Psychology as a discipline uses five main\\nresearch designs. They are:\\n            1.5.2.1. Naturalistic and laboratory observation. In terms of naturalistic observation, the\\nscientist studies human or animal behavior in its natural environment, which could include the home,\\nschool, or a forest. The researcher counts, measures, and rates behavior in a systematic way and, at\\ntimes, uses multiple judges to ensure accuracy in how the behavior is being measured. The advantage\\nof this method is that you see behavior as it happens, and the experimenter does not taint the data. The\\ndisadvantage is that it could take a long time for the behavior to occur, and if the researcher is\\ndetected, then this may influence the behavior of those being observed.\\nLaboratory observation involves observing people or animals in a laboratory setting. The researcher\\nmight want to know more about parent-child interactions, and so, brings a mother and her child into the\\nlab to engage in preplanned tasks such as playing with toys, eating a meal, or the mother leaving the\\nroom for a short time. The advantage of this method over the naturalistic method is that the\\nexperimenter can use sophisticated equipment to record the session and examine it later. The problem\\nis that since the subjects know the experimenter is watching them, their behavior could become\\nartificial. Clinical observation is a commonly employed research method to study psychopathology; we\\nwill talk about it more throughout this book.\\n            1.5.2.2. Case studies. Psychology can also utilize a detailed description of one person or a\\nsmall group based on careful observation. This was the approach the founder of psychoanalysis,\\nSigmund Freud, took to develop his theories. The advantage of this method is that you arrive at a\\ndetailed description of the investigated behavior, but the disadvantage is that the findings may be\\nunrepresentative of the larger population, and thus, lacking generalizability. Again, bear in mind that\\nyou are studying one person or a tiny group. Can you possibly make conclusions about all people from\\njust one person, or even five or ten? The other issue is that the case study is subject to researcher bias\\nin terms of what is included in the final narrative and what is left out. Despite these limitations, case\\nstudies can lead us to novel ideas about the cause of abnormal behavior and help us to study unusual\\nconditions that occur too infrequently to analyze with large sample sizes and in a systematic way.\\n            1.5.2.3. Surveys/Self-Report data. This is a questionnaire consisting of at least one scale with\\nsome questions used to assess a psychological construct of interest such as parenting style, depression,\\nlocus of control, or sensation-seeking behavior. It may be administered by paper and pencil or\\ncomputer. Surveys allow for the collection of large amounts of data quickly, but the actual survey could\\nbe tedious for the participant and social desirability, when a participant answers questions\\ndishonestly so that they are seen in a more favorable light, could be an issue. For instance, if you are\\nasking high school students about their sexual activity, they may not give genuine answers for fear that'),\n",

You could alternatively gather this information via an interview in a\\nstructured or unstructured fashion.\\n            1.5.2.4. Correlational research. This research method examines the relationship between\\ntwo variables or two groups of variables. A numerical measure of the strength of this relationship is\\nderived, called the correlation coefficient. It can range from -1.00, a perfect inverse relationship in\\nwhich one variable goes up as the other goes down, to 0 indicating no relationship at all, to +1.00 or a\\nperfect relationship in which as one variable goes up or down so does the other. In terms of a negative\\ncorrelation, we might say that as a parent becomes more rigid, controlling, and cold, the attachment of\\nthe child to parent goes down. In contrast, as a parent becomes warmer, more loving, and provides\\nstructure, the child becomes more attached. The advantage of correlational research is that you can\\ncorrelate anything. The disadvantage is that you can correlate anything, including variables that do not\\nhave any relationship with one another. Yes, this is both an advantage and a disadvantage. For instance,\\nwe might correlate instances of making peanut butter and jelly sandwiches with someone we are\\nattracted to sitting near us at lunch. Are the two related? Not likely, unless you make a really good\\nPB&J, but then the person is probably only interested in you for food and not companionship. The main\\nissue here is that correlation does not allow you to make a causal statement.\\nA special form of correlational research is the epidemiological study in which the prevalence and\\nincidence of a disorder in a specific population are measured (See Section 1.2 for definitions).\\n            1.5.2.5. Experiments. This is a controlled test of a hypothesis in which a researcher\\nmanipulates one variable and measures its effect on another variable. The manipulated variable is\\ncalled the independent variable (IV), and the one that is measured is called the dependent variable\\n(DV). In the example under Experimentation in Section 1.5.1, the treatment for bipolar disorder was\\nthe IV, while the actual intensity or number of symptoms serve as the DV.  A common feature of\\nexperiments is a control group that does not receive the treatment or is not manipulated and an\\nexperimental group that does receive the treatment or manipulation. If the experiment includes\\nrandom assignment, participants have an equal chance of being placed in the control or experimental\\ngroup. The control group allows the researcher (or teacher) to make a comparison to the experimental\\ngroup and make a causal statement possible, and stronger. In our experiment, the new treatment\\nshould show a marked reduction in the intensity of bipolar symptoms compared to the group receiving\\nno treatment, and perform either at the same level as, or better than, the older treatment. This would\\nbe the initial hypothesis made before starting the experiment.\\nIn a drug study, to ensure the participants’ expectations do not affect the final results by giving the\\nresearcher what he/she is looking for (in our example, symptoms improve whether the participant is\\nreceiving treatment or not), we might use what is called a placebo, or a sugar pill made to look exactly\\nlike the pill given to the experimental group. This way, participants all are given something, but cannot\\nfigure out what exactly it is. You might say this keeps them honest and allows the results to speak for\\nthemselves.\\nFinally, the study of mental illness does not always afford us a large sample of participants to study, so\\nwe have to focus on one individual using a single-subject experimental design. This differs from a\\ncase study in the sheer number of strategies available to reduce potential confounding variables, or\\nvariables not originally part of the research design but contribute to the results in a meaningful way.\\nOne type of single-subject experimental design is the reversal or ABAB design. Kuttler, Myles, and\\nCarson (1998) used social stories to reduce tantrum behavior in two social environments in a 12-year'),\n",

Using an\\nABAB design, they found that precursors to tantrum behavior decreased when the social stories were\\navailable (B) and increased when the intervention was withdrawn (A). A more recent study\\n(Balakrishnan & Alias, 2017) also established the utility of social stories as a social learning tool for\\nchildren with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using an ABAB design. During the baseline phase (A), the\\nfour student participants were observed, and data recorded on an observation form. During the\\ntreatment phase (B), they listened to the social story and data was recorded in the same manner. Upon\\ncompletion of the first B, the students returned to A, which was followed one more time by B and the\\nreading of the social story. Once the second treatment phase ended, the participation was monitored\\nagain to obtain the outcome. All students showed improvement during the treatment phases in terms of\\nthe number of positive peer interactions, but the number of interactions reduced in the absence of\\nsocial stories. From this, the researchers concluded that the social story led to the increase in positive\\npeer interactions of children with ASD.\\n            1.5.2.6. Multi-method research.

This single factor explanation is called a uni-dimensional model. The problem with this\\napproach is that mental disorders are not typically caused by a solitary factor, but multiple causes.\\nAdmittedly, single factors do emerge during a person’s life, but as they arise, the factors become part of\\nthe individual. In time, the cause of the person’s psychopathology is due to all these individual factors.\\n \\n2.1.2. Multi-Dimensional\\nSo, it is better to subscribe to a multi-dimensional model that integrates multiple causes of\\npsychopathology and affirms that each cause comes to affect other causes over time. Uni-dimensional\\nmodels alone are too simplistic to explain the etiology of mental disorders fully.\\nBefore introducing the current main models, it is crucial to understand what a model is. In a general\\nsense, a model is defined as a representation or imitation of an object (dictionary.com). For mental\\nhealth professionals, models help us to understand mental illness since diseases such as depression\\ncannot be touched or experienced firsthand. To be considered distinct from other conditions, a mental\\nillness must have its own set of symptoms. But as you will see, the individual does not have to present\\nwith the entire range of symptoms. For example, to be diagnosed with separation anxiety disorder, you\\nmust present with three of eight symptoms for criteria A whereas for a major depressive episode as part\\nof Bipolar II disorder, you have to display five (or more) symptoms for criteria A. There will be some\\nvariability in terms of what symptoms are displayed, but in general, all people with a specific\\npsychopathology have symptoms from that group.\\nWe can also ask the patient probing questions, seek information from family members, examine medical\\nrecords, and in time, organize and process all this information to better understand the person’s\\ncondition and potential causes. Models aid us with doing all of this. Still, we must remember that the\\nmodel is a starting point for the researcher, and due to this, it determines what causes might be\\ninvestigated at the exclusion of other causes. Often, proponents of a given model find themselves in\\ndisagreement with proponents of other models. All forget that there is no individual model that\\ncompletely explains human behavior, or in this case, abnormal behavior, and so each model contributes\\nin its own way. Here are the models we will examine in this module:\\nBiological – includes genetics, chemical imbalances in the brain, the functioning of the nervous\\nsystem, etc.\\nPsychological – includes learning, personality, stress, cognition, self-efficacy, and early life\\nexperiences.

Communication in the nervous system. To truly understand brain structure and\\nchemistry, it is a good idea to understand how communication occurs within the nervous system. See\\nFigure 2.1 below. Simply:\\nReceptor cells in each of the five sensory systems detect energy.1.\\nThis information is passed to the nervous system due to the process of transduction and through2.\\nsensory or afferent neurons, which are part of the peripheral nervous system.\\nThe information is received by brain structures (central nervous system) and perception occurs.3.\\nOnce the information has been interpreted, commands are sent out, telling the body how to4.\\nrespond (Step E), also via the peripheral nervous system.\\n \\nFigure 2.1. Communication in the Nervous System\\nPlease note that we will not cover this process in full, but just the parts relevant to our topic of\\npsychopathology.\\n            2.2.1.2. The nervous system. The nervous system consists of two main parts – the central and\\nperipheral nervous systems.  The central nervous system (CNS) is the control center for the nervous\\nsystem, which receives, processes, interprets, and stores incoming sensory information. It consists of\\nthe brain and spinal cord. The peripheral nervous system consists of everything outside the brain and\\nspinal cord. It handles the CNS’s input and output and divides into the somatic and autonomic nervous\\nsystems. The somatic nervous system allows for voluntary movement by controlling the skeletal\\nmuscles and carries sensory information to the CNS. The autonomic nervous system regulates the\\nfunctioning of blood vessels, glands, and internal organs such as the bladder, stomach, and heart. It\\nconsists of sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. The sympathetic nervous system is\\ninvolved when a person is intensely aroused. It provides the strength to fight back or to flee (fight-or-\\nflight instinct). Eventually, the response brought about by the sympathetic nervous system must end.\\nThe parasympathetic nervous system calms the body.'),\n",

The Structure of the Nervous System\\n            2.2.1.3. The neuron. The fundamental unit of the nervous system is the neuron, or nerve cell\\n(See Figure 2.3). It has several structures in common with all cells in the body. The nucleus is the\\ncontrol center of the neuron, and the soma is the cell body. In terms of distinctive structures, these\\nfocus on the ability of a neuron to send and receive information. The axon sends signals/information to\\nneighboring neurons while the dendrites, which resemble little trees, receive information from\\nneighboring neurons. Note the plural form of dendrite and the singular form of axon; there are many\\ndendrites but only one axon. Also of importance to the neuron is the myelin sheath or the white, fatty\\ncovering which: 1) provides insulation so that signals from adjacent neurons do not affect one another\\nand, 2) increases the speed at which signals are transmitted. The axon terminals are the end of the\\naxon where the electrical impulse becomes a chemical message and passes to an adjacent neuron.\\nThough not neurons, glial cells play an important part in helping the nervous system to be the efficient\\nmachine that it is. Glial cells are support cells in the nervous system that serve five main functions:\\nThey act as a glue and hold the neuron in place.1.\\nThey form the myelin sheath.2.\\nThey provide nourishment for the cell.3.\\nThey remove waste products.4.\\nThey protect the neuron from harmful substances.5.\\nFinally, nerves are a group of axons bundled together like wires in an electrical cable.\\n \\nFigure 2.3.

Neural transmission. Transducers or receptor cells in the major organs of our five\\nsensory systems – vision (the eyes), hearing (the ears), smell (the nose), touch (the skin), and taste (the\\ntongue) – convert the physical energy that they detect or sense and send it to the brain via the neural\\nimpulse. How so? See Figure 2.4 below. We will cover this process in three parts.\\n \\nPart 1. The Axon and Neural Impulse\\nThe neural impulse proceeds across the following steps:\\nStep 1 – Neurons waiting to fire are said to be in resting potential and polarized, or having a\\nnegative charge inside the neuron and a positive charge outside.\\nStep 2 – If adequately stimulated, the neuron experiences an action potential and becomes\\ndepolarized. When this occurs, voltage-gated ion channels open, allowing positively charged\\nsodium ions (Na+) to enter. This shifts the polarity to positive on the inside and negative outside.\\nNote that ions are charged particles found both inside and outside the neuron.\\nStep 3 – Once the action potential passes from one segment of the axon to the next, the previous\\nsegment begins to repolarize. This occurs because the Na channels close and potassium (K)\\nchannels open. K+ has a positive charge, so the neuron becomes negative again on the inside and\\npositive on the outside.\\nStep 4 – After the neuron fires, it will not fire again no matter how much stimulation it receives.\\nThis is called the absolute refractory period. Think of it as the neuron ABSOLUTELY will not\\nfire, no matter what.\\nStep 5 – After a short time, the neuron can fire again, but needs greater than normal levels of\\nstimulation to do so. This is called the relative refractory period.\\nStep 6 – Please note that this process is cyclical. We started at resting potential in Step 1 and end\\nat resting potential in Step 6.'),\n",

The Action Potential\\nLet’s look at the electrical portion of the process in another way and add some detail.\\n \\nFigure 2.4. The Action Potential\\nRecall that a neuron is usually at resting potential and polarized. The charge inside is -70mV at\\nrest.\\nIf it receives sufficient stimulation, causing the polarity inside the neuron to rise from -70 mV to\\n-55mV (threshold of excitation), the neuron will fire or send an electrical impulse down the\\nlength of the axon (the action potential or depolarization). It should be noted that it either hits\\n-55mV and fires, or it does not fire at all. This is the all-or-nothing principle. The threshold\\nmust be reached.\\nOnce the electrical impulse has passed from one segment of the axon to the next, the neuron\\nbegins the process of resetting called repolarization.\\nDuring repolarization the neuron will not fire no matter how much stimulation it receives. This is\\ncalled the absolute refractory period.\\nThe neuron next moves into a relative refractory period, meaning it can fire but needs higher than\\nnormal levels of stimulation. Notice how the line has dropped below -70mV. Hence, to reach\\n-55mV and fire, it will need more than the normal gain of +15mV (-70 to -55 mV).\\nAnd then we return to resting potential, as you saw in Figure 2.4\\n \\nPart 3. The Synapse\\nThe electrical portion of the neural impulse is just the start. The actual code passes from one neuron to\\nanother in a chemical form called a neurotransmitter. The point where this occurs is called the\\nsynapse. The synapse consists of three parts – the axon of the sending neuron, the space in between\\ncalled the synaptic space, gap, or cleft, and the dendrite of the receiving neuron. Once the electrical\\nimpulse reaches the end of the axon, called the axon terminal, it stimulates synaptic vesicles or\\nneurotransmitter sacs to release the neurotransmitter. Neurotransmitters will only bind to their specific'),\n",

You might say\\nneurotransmitters are part of a lock-and-key system. What happens to the neurotransmitters that do not\\nbind to a receptor site? They might go through reuptake, which is the process of the presynaptic\\nneuron taking up excess neurotransmitters in the synaptic space for future use or enzymatic\\ndegradation when enzymes destroy excess neurotransmitters in the synaptic space.\\n            2.2.1.5. Neurotransmitters. What exactly are some of the neurotransmitters which are so\\ncritical for neural transmission, and are essential to our discussion of psychopathology?\\nDopamine – controls voluntary movements and is associated with the reward mechanism in the\\nbrain\\nSerotonin – regulates pain, sleep cycle, and digestion; leads to a stable mood, so low levels lead\\nto depression\\nEndorphins – involved in reducing pain and making the person calm and happy\\nNorepinephrine – increases the heart rate and blood pressure and regulates mood\\nGABA – blocks the signals of excitatory neurotransmitters responsible for anxiety and panic\\nGlutamate – associated with learning and memory\\nThe critical thing to understand here is that there is a belief in the realm of mental health that chemical\\nimbalances are responsible for many mental disorders. Chief among these are neurotransmitter\\nimbalances. For instance, people with Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) have difficulty regulating\\nserotonin. More on this throughout the book as we discuss each disorder.\\n           2.2.1.6. The brain. The central nervous system consists of the brain and spinal cord; the\\nformer we will discuss briefly and in terms of key structures which include:\\nMedulla – regulates breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure\\nPons – acts as a bridge connecting the cerebellum and medulla and helps to transfer messages\\nbetween different parts of the brain and spinal cord\\nReticular formation – responsible for alertness and attention\\nCerebellum – involved in our sense of balance and for coordinating the body’s muscles so that\\nmovement is smooth and precise. Involved in the learning of certain kinds of simple responses and\\nacquired reflexes.\\nThalamus – the major sensory relay center for all senses except smell\\nHypothalamus – involved in drives associated with the survival of both the individual and the\\nspecies. It regulates temperature by triggering sweating or shivering and controls the complex\\noperations of the autonomic nervous system\\nAmygdala – responsible for evaluating sensory information and quickly determining its emotional\\nimportance\\nHippocampus – our “gateway” to memory. Allows us to form spatial memories so that we can\\naccurately navigate through our environment and helps us to form new memories about facts and\\nevents\\nThe cerebrum has four distinct regions in each cerebral hemisphere. First, the frontal lobe\\ncontains the motor cortex, which issues orders to the muscles of the body that produce voluntary\\nmovement. The frontal lobe is also involved in emotion and in the ability to make plans, think\\ncreatively, and take initiative.

Finally, the temporal lobe is involved in memory,\\nperception, and emotion. It contains the auditory cortex which processes sound.\\nOf course, this is not an exhaustive list of structures found in the brain but gives you a pretty good idea\\nof function and which structure is responsible for it. What is important to mental health professionals is\\nsome disorders involve specific areas of the brain. For instance, Parkinson’s disease is a brain disorder\\nthat results in a gradual loss of muscle control and arises when cells in the substantia nigra, a long\\nnucleus considered to be part of the basal ganglia, stop making dopamine. As these cells die, the brain\\nfails to receive messages about when and how to move. In the case of depression, low levels of\\nserotonin are responsible, at least partially. New evidence suggests “nerve cell connections, nerve cell\\ngrowth, and the functioning of nerve circuits have a major impact on depression… and areas that play a\\nsignificant role in depression are the amygdala, the thalamus, and the hippocampus.” Also, individuals\\nwith borderline personality disorder have been shown to have structural and functional changes in\\nbrain areas associated with impulse control and emotional regulation, while imaging studies reveal\\ndifferences in the frontal cortex and subcortical structures for those suffering from OCD.\\nCheck out the following from Harvard Health for more on depression and the brain as a cause:\\nhttps://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/what-causes-depression\\n \\n2.2.2. Genes, Hormonal Imbalances, and Viral Infections\\n            2.2.2.1. Genetic issues and explanations. DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is our heredity\\nmaterial. It exists in the nucleus of each cell, packaged in threadlike structures known as chromosomes,\\nfor which we have 23 pairs or 46 total. Twenty-two of the pairs are the same in both sexes, but the 23rd\\npair is called the sex chromosome and differs between males and females. Males have X and Y\\nchromosomes while females have two Xs. According to the Genetics Home Reference website as part of\\nNIH’s National Library of Medicine, a gene is “the basic physical and functional unit of heredity”\\n(https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/basics/gene). They act as the instructions to make proteins, and it is\\nestimated by the Human Genome Project that we have between 20,000 and 25,000 genes. We all have\\ntwo copies of each gene, one inherited from our mother and one from our father.\\nRecent research has discovered that autism, ADHD, bipolar disorder, major depression, and\\nschizophrenia all share genetic roots. They “were more likely to have suspect genetic variation at the\\nsame four chromosomal sites. These included risk versions of two genes that regulate the flow of\\ncalcium into cells.” Likewise, twin and family studies have shown that people with first-degree relatives\\nsuffering from OCD are at higher risk to develop the disorder themselves. The same is true of\\nborderline personality disorder.\\nWebMD adds, “Experts believe many mental illnesses are linked to abnormalities in many genes rather\\nthan just one or a few and that how these genes interact with the environment is unique for every\\nperson (even identical twins). That is why a person inherits a susceptibility to a mental illness and\\ndoesn’t necessarily develop the illness. Mental illness itself occurs from the interaction of multiple\\ngenes and other factors–such as stress, abuse, or a traumatic event–which can influence, or trigger, an\\nillness in a person who has an inherited susceptibility to it”\\n(https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/mental-health-causes-mental-illness#1).'),\n",

Hormonal imbalances. The body has two coordinating and integrating systems, the\\nnervous system and the endocrine system. The main difference between these two systems is the speed\\nwith which they act. The nervous system moves quickly with nerve impulses moving in a few\\nhundredths of a second. The endocrine system moves slowly with hormones, released by endocrine\\nglands, taking seconds, or even minutes, to reach their target. Hormones are important to psychologists\\nbecause they manage the nervous system and body tissues at certain stages of development and\\nactivate behaviors such as alertness or sleepiness, sexual behavior, concentration, aggressiveness,\\nreaction to stress, and a desire for companionship. The pituitary gland is the “master gland” which\\nregulates other endocrine glands. It influences blood pressure, thirst, contractions of the uterus during\\nchildbirth, milk production, sexual behavior and interest, body growth, the amount of water in the\\nbody’s cells, and other functions as well. The pineal gland helps regulate the sleep-wake cycle while\\nthe thyroid gland regulates the body’s energy levels by controlling metabolism and the basal metabolic\\nrate (BMR). It regulates the body’s rate of metabolism and so how energetic people are.\\nOf importance to mental health professionals are the adrenal glands, located on top of the kidneys,\\nand which release cortisol to help the body deal with stress. Elevated levels of this hormone can lead to\\nseveral problems, including increased weight gain, interference with learning and memory, reduced\\nbone density, high cholesterol, and an increased risk of depression. Similarly, the overproduction of the\\nhormone melatonin can lead to SAD.\\nFor more on the link between cortisol and depression, check out this article:\\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-athletes-way/201301/cortisol-why-the-stress-hormone-is-pub\\nlic-enemy-no-1\\n      2.2.2.3. Bacterial and viral infections. Infections can cause brain damage and lead to the\\ndevelopment of mental illness or exacerbate existing symptoms. For instance, evidence suggests that\\ncontracting strep throat, “an infection in the throat and tonsils caused by bacteria called group A\\nStreptococcus” (for more on strep throat, please visit\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/groupastrep/diseases-public/strep-throat.html), can lead to the development of\\nOCD, Tourette’s syndrome, and tic disorder in children (Mell, Davis, & Owens, 2005; Giedd et al., 2000;\\nAllen et al., 1995;\\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-perfectionists-handbook/201202/can-infections-result-in-men\\ntal-illness). Influenza epidemics, caused by viral infections (for more on influenza, please see the\\nfollowing: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/flu/symptoms-causes/syc-20351719),  have\\nalso been linked to schizophrenia (Brown et al., 2004; McGrath and Castle, 1995; McGrath et al., 1994;\\nO’callaghan et al., 1991) though more recent research suggests this evidence is weak at best (Selten &\\nTermorshuizen, 2017; Ebert & Kotler, 2005).'),\n",

Treatments\\n            2.2.3.1. Psychopharmacology and psychotropic drugs. One option to treat severe mental\\nillness is psychotropic medications. These medications fall under five major categories.\\nAntidepressants are used to treat depression, but also anxiety, insomnia, and pain. The most common\\ntypes of antidepressants are SSRIs or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and include Citalopram,\\nParoxetine, and Fluoxetine (Prozac). Possible side effects include weight gain, sleepiness, nausea and\\nvomiting, panic attacks, or thoughts about suicide or dying.\\nAnti-anxiety medications help with the symptoms of anxiety and include benzodiazepines such as\\nClonazepam, Alprazolam, and Lorazepam. “Anti-anxiety medications such as benzodiazepines are\\neffective in relieving anxiety and take effect more quickly than the antidepressant medications (or\\nbuspirone) often prescribed for anxiety. However, people can build up a tolerance to benzodiazepines if\\nthey are taken over a long period of time and may need higher and higher doses to get the same effect.”\\nSide effects include drowsiness, dizziness, nausea, difficulty urinating, and irregular heartbeat, to name\\na few.\\nStimulants increase one’s alertness and attention and are frequently used to treat ADHD. They include\\nLisdexamfetamine, the combination of dextroamphetamine and amphetamine, and Methylphenidate.\\nStimulants are generally effective and produce a calming effect. Possible side effects include loss of\\nappetite, headache, motor or verbal tics, and personality changes such as appearing emotionless.\\nAntipsychotics are used to treat psychosis or “conditions that affect the mind, and in which there has\\nbeen some loss of contact with reality, often including delusions (false, fixed beliefs) or hallucinations\\n(hearing or seeing things that are not really there).” They can be used to treat eating disorders, severe\\ndepression, PTSD, OCD, ADHD, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Common antipsychotics include\\nChlorpromazine, Perphenazine, Quetiapine, and Lurasidone. Side effects include nausea, vomiting,\\nblurred vision, weight gain, restlessness, tremors, and rigidity.\\nMood stabilizers are used to treat bipolar disorder and, at times, depression, schizoaffective disorder,\\nand disorders of impulse control. A common example is Lithium; side effects include loss of\\ncoordination, hallucinations, seizures, and frequent urination.\\nFor more information on psychotropic medications, please visit:\\nhttps://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/mental-health-medications/index.shtml\\nThe use of these drugs has been generally beneficial to patients. Most report that their symptoms\\ndecline, leading them to feel better and improve their functioning. Also, long-term hospitalizations are\\nless likely to occur as a result, though the medications do not benefit the individual in terms of\\nimproved living skills.\\n            2.2.3.2. Electroconvulsive therapy. According to Mental Health America, “Electroconvulsive\\ntherapy (ECT) is a procedure in which a brief application of electric stimulus is used to produce a\\ngeneralized seizure.” Patients are placed on a padded bed and administered a muscle relaxant to avoid\\ninjury during the seizures. Annually, approximately 100,000 undergo ECT to treat conditions such as'),\n",

Its popularity has\\ndeclined since the 1960s and 1970s.\\n            2.2.3.3. Psychosurgery. Another option to treat mental disorders is to perform brain\\nsurgeries. In the past, we have conducted trephination and lobotomies, neither of which are used today.\\nToday’s techniques are much more sophisticated and have been used to treat schizophrenia,\\ndepression, and some personality and anxiety disorders. However, critics cite obvious ethical issues\\nwith conducting such surgeries as well as scientific issues.\\nFor more on psychosurgery, check out this article from Psychology Today:\\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/199203/psychosurgery\\n \\n \\n2.2.4. Evaluation of the Model\\nThe biological model is generally well respected today but suffers a few key issues. First, consider the\\nlist of side effects given for psychotropic medications. You might make the case that some of the side\\neffects are worse than the condition they are treating. Second, the viewpoint that all human behavior is\\nexplainable in biological terms, and therefore when issues arise, they can be treated using biological\\nmethods, overlooks factors that are not fundamentally biological. More on that over the next two\\nsections.\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nProponents of the biological model view mental illness as being a result of a malfunction in the\\nbody to include issues with brain anatomy or chemistry.\\nNeurotransmitter imbalances and problems with brain structures/areas can result in mental\\ndisorders.\\nMany disorders have genetic roots, are a result of hormonal imbalances, or caused by viral\\ninfections such as strep.\\nTreatments related to the biological model include drugs, ECT, and psychosurgery.\\n \\nSection 2.2 Review Questions'),\n",

She felt confined and suffocated in this life and took\\nto a fantasy world she called her “private theater.” Anna also developed hysteria, including symptoms\\nsuch as memory loss, paralysis, disturbed eye movements, reduced speech, nausea, and mental\\ndeterioration. Her symptoms appeared as she cared for her dying father, and her mother called on\\nBreuer to diagnosis her condition (note that Freud never actually treated her). Hypnosis was used at\\nfirst and relieved her symptoms, as it had done for many patients (See Module 1). Breuer made daily\\nvisits and allowed her to share stories from her private theater, which she came to call “talking cure” or\\n“chimney sweeping.” Many of the stories she shared were actually thoughts or events she found\\ntroubling and reliving them helped to relieve or eliminate the symptoms. Breuer’s wife, Mathilde,\\nbecame jealous of her husband’s relationship with the young girl, leading Breuer to terminate treatment\\nin June of 1882 before Anna had fully recovered. She relapsed and was admitted to Bellevue Sanatorium\\non July 1, eventually being released in October of the same year. With time, Anna O. did recover from\\nher hysteria and went on to become a prominent member of the Jewish Community, involving herself in\\nsocial work, volunteering at soup kitchens, and becoming ‘House Mother’ at an orphanage for Jewish\\ngirls in 1895. Bertha (Anna O.) became involved in the German Feminist movement, and in 1904\\nfounded the League of Jewish Women. She published many short stories; a play called Women’s Rights,\\nin which she criticized the economic and sexual exploitation of women; and wrote a book in 1900 called\\nThe Jewish Problem in Galicia, in which she blamed the poverty of the Jews of Eastern Europe on their\\nlack of education. In 1935, Bertha was diagnosed with a tumor, and in 1936, she was summoned by the\\nGestapo to explain anti-Hitler statements she had allegedly made. She died shortly after this\\ninterrogation on May 28, 1936. Freud considered the talking cure of Anna O. to be the origin of\\npsychoanalytic therapy and what would come to be called the cathartic method.\\nFor more on Anna O., please see:\\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/freuds-patients-serial/201201/bertha-pappenheim-1859-1936\\n            2.3.1.1. The structure of personality. Freud’s psychoanalysis was unique in the history of\\npsychology because it did not arise within universities as most major schools of thought did; rather, it\\nemerged from medicine and psychiatry to address psychopathology and examine the unconscious.\\n Freud believed that consciousness had three levels – 1) consciousness which was the seat of our\\nawareness, 2) preconscious that included all of our sensations, thoughts, memories, and feelings, and\\n3) the unconscious, which was not available to us. The contents of the unconscious could move from\\nthe unconscious to preconscious, but to do so, it had to pass a Gate Keeper. Content that was turned\\naway was said to be repressed.\\nAccording to Freud, our personality has three parts – the id, superego, and ego, and from these our\\nbehavior arises. First, the id is the impulsive part that expresses our sexual and aggressive instincts. It\\nis present at birth, completely unconscious, and operates on the pleasure principle, resulting in selfishly\\nseeking immediate gratification of our needs no matter what the cost. The second part of personality\\nemerges after birth with early formative experiences and is called the ego. The ego attempts to mediate\\nthe desires of the id against the demands of reality, and eventually, the moral limitations or guidelines\\nof the superego. It operates on the reality principle, or an awareness of the need to adjust behavior, to\\nmeet the demands of our environment. The last part of the personality to develop is the superego,\\nwhich represents society’s expectations, moral standards, rules, and represents our conscience. It leads'),\n",

The superego is partly conscious\\nbut mostly unconscious, and part of it becomes our conscience. The three parts of personality generally\\nwork together well and compromise, leading to a healthy personality, but if the conflict is not resolved,\\nintrapsychic conflicts can arise and lead to mental disorders.\\nPersonality develops over five distinct stages in which the libido focuses on different parts of the body.\\nFirst, libido is the psychic energy that drives a person to pleasurable thoughts and behaviors. Our life\\ninstincts, or Eros, are manifested through it and are the creative forces that sustain life. They include\\nhunger, thirst, self-preservation, and sex. In contrast, Thanatos, our death instinct, is either directed\\ninward as in the case of suicide and masochism or outward via hatred and aggression. Both types of\\ninstincts are sources of stimulation in the body and create a state of tension that is unpleasant, thereby\\nmotivating us to reduce them. Consider hunger, and the associated rumbling of our stomach, fatigue,\\nlack of energy, etc., that motivates us to find and eat food. If we are angry at someone, we may engage\\nin physical or relational aggression to alleviate this stimulation.\\n            2.3.1.2. The development of personality. Freud’s psychosexual stages of personality\\ndevelopment are listed below. Please note that a person may become fixated at any stage, meaning\\nthey become stuck, thereby affecting later development and possibly leading to abnormal functioning,\\nor psychopathology.\\nOral Stage – Beginning at birth and lasting to 24 months, the libido is focused on the mouth.1.\\nSexual tension is relieved by sucking and swallowing at first, and then later by chewing and biting\\nas baby teeth come in. Fixation is linked to a lack of confidence, argumentativeness, and sarcasm.\\nAnal Stage – Lasting from 2-3 years, the libido is focused on the anus as toilet training occurs. If2.\\nparents are too lenient, children may become messy or unorganized. If parents are too strict,\\nchildren may become obstinate, stingy, or orderly.\\nPhallic Stage – Occurring from about age 3 to 5-6 years, the libido is focused on the genitals, and3.\\nchildren develop an attachment to the parent of the opposite sex and are jealous of the same-sex\\nparent. The Oedipus complex develops in boys and results in the son falling in love with his\\nmother while fearing that his father will find out and castrate him. Meanwhile, girls fall in love\\nwith the father and fear that their mother will find out, called the Electra complex. A fixation at\\nthis stage may result in low self-esteem, feelings of worthlessness, and shyness.\\nLatency Stage – From 6-12 years of age, children lose interest in sexual behavior, so boys play4.\\nwith boys and girls with girls. Neither sex pays much attention to the opposite sex.\\nGenital Stage – Beginning at puberty, sexual impulses reawaken and unfulfilled desires from5.\\ninfancy and childhood can be satisfied during lovemaking.\\n            2.3.1.3. Dealing with anxiety. The ego has a challenging job to fulfill, balancing both the will\\nof the id and the superego, and the overwhelming anxiety and panic this creates. Ego-defense\\nmechanisms are in place to protect us from this pain but are considered maladaptive if they are\\nmisused and become our primary way of dealing with stress. They protect us from anxiety and operate\\nunconsciously by distorting reality. Defense mechanisms include the following:\\nRepression – When unacceptable ideas, wishes, desires, or memories are blocked from\\nconsciousness such as forgetting a horrific car accident that you caused. Eventually, though, it\\nmust be dealt with, or the repressed memory can cause problems later in life.\\nReaction formation – When an impulse is repressed and then expressed by its opposite.

Another example is having lustful thoughts about a coworker than you cannot express\\nbecause you are married, so you are extremely hateful to this person.\\nDisplacement – When we satisfy an impulse with a different object because focusing on the\\nprimary object may get us in trouble. A classic example is taking out your frustration with your\\nboss on your wife and/or kids when you get home. If you lash out at your boss, you could be fired.\\nThe substitute target is less dangerous than the primary target.\\nProjection – When we attribute threatening desires or unacceptable motives to others. An\\nexample is when we do not have the skills necessary to complete a task, but we blame the other\\nmembers of our group for being incompetent and unreliable.\\nSublimation – When we find a socially acceptable way to express a desire. If we are stressed out\\nor upset, we may go to the gym and box or lift weights. A person who desires to cut things may\\nbecome a surgeon.\\nDenial – Sometimes, life is so hard that all we can do is deny how bad it is. An example is denying\\na diagnosis of lung cancer given by your doctor.\\nIdentification – When we find someone who has found a socially acceptable way to satisfy their\\nunconscious wishes and desires, and we model that behavior.\\nRegression – When we move from a mature behavior to one that is infantile. If your significant\\nother is nagging you, you might regress by putting your hands over your ears and saying, “La la la\\nla la la la la…”\\nRationalization – When we offer well-thought-out reasons for why we did what we did, but these\\nare not the real reason. Students sometimes rationalize not doing well in a class by stating that\\nthey really are not interested in the subject or saying the instructor writes impossible-to-pass\\ntests.\\nIntellectualization – When we avoid emotion by focusing on the intellectual aspects of a\\nsituation such as ignoring the sadness we are feeling after the death of our mother by focusing on\\nplanning the funeral.\\nFor more on defense mechanisms, please visit:\\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/fulfillment-any-age/201110/the-essential-guide-defense-mechani\\nsms\\n            2.3.1.4. Psychodynamic techniques. Freud used three primary assessment techniques—free\\nassociation, transference, and dream analysis—as part of psychoanalysis, or psychoanalytic therapy, to\\nunderstand the personalities of his patients and expose repressed material. First, free association\\ninvolves the patient describing whatever comes to mind during the session. The patient continues but\\nalways reaches a point when he/she cannot or will not proceed any further. The patient might change\\nthe subject, stop talking, or lose his/her train of thought. Freud said this resistance revealed where\\nissues persisted.\\nSecond, transference is the process through which patients transfer attitudes he/she held during\\nchildhood to the therapist. They may be positive and include friendly, affectionate feelings, or negative,\\nand include hostile and angry feelings. The goal of therapy is to wean patients from their childlike\\ndependency on the therapist.\\nFinally, Freud used dream analysis to understand a person’s innermost wishes.

In terms of the latter, some symbols are linked to the person\\nspecifically, while others are common to all people.\\n        2.3.1.5. Evaluating psychodynamic theory. Freud’s psychodynamic theory made a lasting\\nimpact on the field of psychology but also has been criticized heavily. First, Freud made most of his\\nobservations in an unsystematic, uncontrolled way, and he relied on the case study method. Second, the\\nparticipants in his studies were not representative of the broader population. Despite Freud’s\\ngeneralization, his theory was based on only a few patients.  Third, he relied solely on the reports of his\\npatients and sought no observer reports. Fourth, it is difficult to empirically study psychodynamic\\nprinciples since most operate unconsciously. This begs the question of how we can really know that they\\nexist. Finally, psychoanalytic treatment is expensive and time consuming, and since Freud’s time, drug\\ntherapies have become more popular and successful. Still, Sigmund Freud developed useful therapeutic\\ntools for clinicians and raised awareness about the role the unconscious plays in both normal and\\nabnormal behavior.\\n \\n2.3.2. The Behavioral Model\\n            2.3.2.1. What is learning? The behavioral model concerns the cognitive process of learning,\\nwhich is any relatively permanent change in behavior due to experience and practice. Learning has two\\nmain forms – associative learning and observational learning. First, associative learning is the linking\\ntogether of information sensed from our environment. Conditioning, or a type of associative learning,\\noccurs when two separate events become connected. There are two forms: classical conditioning, or\\nlinking together two types of stimuli, and operant conditioning, or linking together a response with its\\nconsequence. Second, observational learning occurs when we learn by observing the world around\\nus.\\nWe should also note the existence of non-associative learning or when there is no linking of information\\nor observing the actions of others around you. Types include habituation, or when we simply stop\\nresponding to repetitive and harmless stimuli in our environment such as a fan running in your laptop\\nas you work on a paper, and sensitization, or when our reactions are increased due to a strong\\nstimulus, such as an individual who experienced a mugging and now panics when someone walks up\\nbehind him/her on the street.\\nBehaviorism is the school of thought associated with learning that began in 1913 with the publication of\\nJohn B. Watson’s article, “Psychology as the Behaviorist Views It,” in the journal Psychological Review\\n(Watson, 1913). Watson believed that the subject matter of psychology was to be observable behavior,\\nand to that end, psychology should focus on the prediction and control of behavior. Behaviorism was\\ndominant from 1913 to 1990 before being absorbed into mainstream psychology. It went through three\\nmajor stages – behaviorism proper under Watson and lasting from 1913-1930 (discussed as\\nclassical/respondent conditioning), neobehaviorism under Skinner and lasting from 1930-1960\\n(discussed as operant conditioning), and sociobehaviorism under Bandura and Rotter and lasting from\\n1960-1990 (discussed as social learning theory).\\n            2.3.2.2. Respondent conditioning. You have likely heard about Pavlov and his dogs, but what\\nyou may not know is that this was a discovery made accidentally. Ivan Petrovich Pavlov (1906, 1927,\\n1928), a Russian physiologist, was interested in studying digestive processes in dogs in response to'),\n",

What he discovered was the dogs would salivate even before the meat powder\\nwas presented. They would salivate at the sound of a bell, footsteps in the hall, a tuning fork, or the\\npresence of a lab assistant. Pavlov realized some stimuli automatically elicited responses (such as\\nsalivating to meat powder) and other stimuli had to be paired with these automatic associations for the\\nanimal or person to respond to it (such as salivating to a bell). Armed with this stunning revelation,\\nPavlov spent the rest of his career investigating the learning phenomenon.\\nThe important thing to understand is that not all behaviors occur due to reinforcement and punishment\\nas operant conditioning says. In the case of respondent conditioning, stimuli exert complete and\\nautomatic control over some behaviors. We see this in the case of reflexes. When a doctor strikes your\\nknee with that little hammer, your leg extends out automatically. Another example is how a baby will\\nroot for a food source if the mother’s breast is placed near their mouth. And if a nipple is placed in their\\nmouth, they will also automatically suck via the sucking reflex. Humans have several of these reflexes,\\nthough not as many as other animals due to our more complicated nervous system.\\nRespondent conditioning (also called classical or Pavlovian conditioning) occurs when we link a\\npreviously neutral stimulus with a stimulus that is unlearned or inborn, called an unconditioned\\nstimulus. In respondent conditioning, learning happens in three phases: preconditioning, conditioning,\\nand postconditioning. See Figure 2.5 for an overview of Pavlov’s classic experiment.\\nPreconditioning. Notice that preconditioning has both an A and a B panel. All this stage of learning\\nsignifies is that some learning is already present. There is no need to learn it again, as in the case of\\nprimary reinforcers and punishers in operant conditioning. In Panel A, food makes a dog salivate. This\\nresponse does not need to be learned and shows the relationship between an unconditioned stimulus\\n(UCS) yielding an unconditioned response (UCR). Unconditioned means unlearned. In Panel B, we see\\nthat a neutral stimulus (NS) produces no response. Dogs do not enter the world knowing to respond to\\nthe ringing of a bell (which it hears).\\nConditioning. Conditioning is when learning occurs. By pairing a neutral stimulus and unconditioned\\nstimulus (bell and food, respectively), the dog will learn that the bell ringing (NS) signals food coming\\n(UCS) and salivate (UCR). The pairing must occur more than once so that needless pairings are not\\nlearned such as someone farting right before your food comes out and now you salivate whenever\\nsomeone farts (…at least for a while. Eventually the fact that no food comes will extinguish this reaction\\nbut still, it will be weird for a bit).\\n \\nFigure 2.5. Pavlov’s Classic Experiment'),\n",

Postconditioning, or after learning has occurred, establishes a new and not\\nnaturally occurring relationship of a conditioned stimulus (CS; previously the NS) and conditioned\\nresponse (CR; the same response). So the dog now reliably salivates at the sound of the bell because he\\nexpects that food will follow, and it does.\\nWatson and Rayner (1920) conducted one of the most famous studies in psychology. Essentially, they\\nwanted to explore “the possibility of conditioning various types of emotional response(s).” The\\nresearchers ran a series of trials in which they exposed a 9-month-old child, known as Little Albert, to a\\nwhite rat. Little Albert made no response outside of curiosity (NS–NR not shown). Panel A of Figure 2.6\\nshows the naturally occurring response to the stimulus of a loud sound. On later trials, the rat was\\npresented (NS) and followed closely by a loud sound (UCS; Panel B). After several conditioning trials,\\nthe child responded with fear to the mere presence of the white rat (Panel C).\\n \\nFigure 2.6. Learning to Fear'),\n",

Considered the follow-up to Watson and Rayner\\n(1920), Jones (1924; Figure 2.7) wanted to see if a child who learned to be afraid of white rabbits (Panel\\nB) could be conditioned to become unafraid of them. Simply, she placed the child in one end of a room\\nand then brought in the rabbit. The rabbit was far enough away so as not to cause distress. Then, Jones\\ngave the child some pleasant food (i.e., something sweet such as cookies [Panel C]; remember the\\nresponse to the food is unlearned, i.e., Panel A). The procedure in Panel C continued with the rabbit\\nbeing brought a bit closer each time until, eventually, the child did not respond with distress to the\\nrabbit (Panel D).\\n \\nFigure 2.7.

That is the idea, at least. So, if you were afraid of\\nclowns, you would be thrown into a room full of clowns. Hmm….\\nFinally, respondent conditioning has several properties:\\nRespondent Generalization – When many similar CSs or a broad range of CSs elicit the same\\nCR. An example is the sound of a whistle eliciting salivation much the same as a ringing bell, both\\ndetected via audition.\\nRespondent Discrimination – When a single CS or a narrow range of CSs elicits a CR, i.e.,\\nteaching the dog to respond to a specific bell and ignore the whistle. The whistle would not be\\nfollowed by food, eventually leading to….\\nRespondent Extinction – When the CS is no longer paired with the UCS. The sound of a school\\nbell ringing (new CS that was generalized) is not followed by food (UCS), and so eventually, the\\ndog stops salivating (the CR).\\nSpontaneous Recovery – When the CS elicits the CR after extinction has occurred. Eventually,\\nthe school bell will ring, making the dog salivate. If no food comes, the behavior will not continue.\\nIf food appears, the salivation response will be re-established.\\n            2.3.2.3. Operant conditioning. Influential on the development of Skinner’s operant\\nconditioning, Thorndike (1905) proposed the law of effect or the idea that if our behavior produces a\\nfavorable consequence, in the future when the same stimulus is present, we will be more likely to make\\nthe response again, expecting the same favorable consequence. Likewise, if our action leads to\\ndissatisfaction, then we will not repeat the same behavior in the future. He developed the law of effect\\nthanks to his work with a puzzle box. Cats were food deprived the night before the experimental\\nprocedure was to occur. The next morning, researchers placed a hungry cat in the puzzle box and set a\\nsmall amount of food outside the box, just close enough to be smelled. The cat could escape the box and\\nreach the food by manipulating a series of levers. Once free, the cat was allowed to eat some food\\nbefore being promptly returned to the box. With each subsequent escape and re-insertion into the box,\\nthe cat became faster at correctly manipulating the levers. This scenario demonstrates trial and error\\nlearning or making a response repeatedly if it leads to success. Thorndike also said that stimulus and\\nresponses were connected by the organism, and this led to learning. This approach to learning was\\ncalled connectionism.\\nOperant conditioning is a type of associate learning which focuses on consequences that follow a\\nresponse or behavior that we make (anything we do or say) and whether it makes a behavior more or\\nless likely to occur. This should sound much like what you just read about in terms of Thorndike’s work.\\nSkinner talked about contingencies or when one thing occurs due to another. Think of it as an If-Then\\nstatement. If I do X, then Y will happen. For operant conditioning, this means that if I make a behavior,\\nthen a specific consequence will follow. The events (response and consequence) are linked in time.\\nWhat form do these consequences take? There are two main ways they can present themselves.\\nReinforcement – Due to the consequence, a behavior/response is strengthened and more\\nlikely to occur in the future.\\nPunishment – Due to the consequence, a behavior/response is weakened and less likely to\\noccur in the future.'),\n",

These words have no\\naffective connotation to them, meaning they do not imply good or bad. Positive means that you are\\ngiving something – good or bad. Negative means that something is being taken away – good or bad.\\nCheck out the figure below for how these contingencies are arranged.\\n \\nFigure 2.8. Contingencies in Operant Conditioning\\nLet’s go through each:\\nPositive Punishment (PP) – If something bad or aversive is given or added, then the behavior is\\nless likely to occur in the future. If you talk back to your mother and she slaps your mouth, this is\\na PP. Your response of talking back led to the consequence of the aversive slap being given to\\nyour face. Ouch!!!\\nPositive Reinforcement (PR) – If something good is given or added, then the behavior is more\\nlikely to occur in the future. If you study hard and receive an A on your exam, you will be more\\nlikely to study hard in the future. Similarly, your parents may give you money for your stellar\\nperformance. Cha Ching!!!\\nNegative Reinforcement (NR) – This is a tough one for students to comprehend because the\\nterms seem counterintuitive, even though we experience NR all the time. NR is when something\\nbad or aversive is taken away or subtracted due to your actions, making it that you will be more\\nlikely to make the same behavior in the future when the same stimulus presents itself. For\\ninstance, what do you do if you have a headache? If you take Tylenol and the pain goes away, you\\nwill likely take Tylenol in the future when you have a headache. NR can either result in current\\nescape behavior or future avoidance behavior. What does this mean? Escape occurs when we are\\npresently experiencing an aversive event and want it to end. We make a behavior and if the\\naversive event, like the headache, goes away, we will repeat the taking of Tylenol in the future.\\nThis future action is an avoidance event. We might start to feel a headache coming on and run to\\ntake Tylenol right away. By doing so, we have removed the possibility of the aversive event\\noccurring, and this behavior demonstrates that learning has occurred.\\nNegative Punishment (NP) – This is when something good is taken away or subtracted, making'),\n",

If you are late to class and your professor deducts 5 points\\nfrom your final grade (the points are something good and the loss is negative), you will hopefully\\nbe on time in all subsequent classes.\\nThe type of reinforcer or punisher we use is crucial. Some are naturally occurring, while others need to\\nbe learned. We describe these as primary and secondary reinforcers and punishers. Primary refers to\\nreinforcers and punishers that have their effect without having to be learned. Food, water, temperature,\\nand sex, for instance, are primary reinforcers, while extreme cold or hot or a punch on the arm are\\ninherently punishing. A story will illustrate the latter. When I was about eight years old, I would walk up\\nthe street in my neighborhood, saying, “I’m Chicken Little and you can’t hurt me.” Most ignored me, but\\nsome gave me the attention I was seeking, a positive reinforcer. So I kept doing it and doing it until one\\nday, another kid grew tired of hearing about my other identity and punched me in the face. The pain\\nwas enough that I never walked up and down the street echoing my identity crisis for all to hear. This\\nwas a positive punisher that did not have to be learned, and definitely not one of my finer moments in\\nlife.\\nSecondary or conditioned reinforcers and punishers are not inherently reinforcing or punishing but\\nmust be learned. An example was the attention I received for saying I was Chicken Little. Over time I\\nlearned that attention was good. Other examples of secondary reinforcers include praise, a smile,\\ngetting money for working or earning good grades, stickers on a board, points, getting to go out\\ndancing, and getting out of an exam if you are doing well in a class. Examples of secondary punishers\\ninclude a ticket for speeding, losing television or video game privileges, ridicule, or a fee for paying\\nyour rent or credit card bill late. Really, the sky is the limit with reinforcers in particular.\\nIn operant conditioning, the rule for determining when and how often we will reinforce the desired\\nbehavior is called the reinforcement schedule. Reinforcement can either occur continuously meaning\\nevery time the desired behavior is made the subject will receive some reinforcer, or\\nintermittently/partially meaning reinforcement does not occur with every behavior. Our focus will be on\\npartial/intermittent reinforcement.\\n \\nFigure 2.9. Key Components of Reinforcement Schedules'),\n",

In the case of when, it will be either fixed or at a set rate, or\\nvariable and at a rate that changes. In terms of what is being reinforced, we will either reinforce\\nresponses or time. These two components pair up as follows:\\nFixed Ratio schedule (FR) – With this schedule, we reinforce some set number of responses.\\nFor instance, every twenty problems (fixed) a student gets correct (ratio), the teacher gives him\\nan extra credit point. A specific behavior is being reinforced – getting problems correct. Note that\\nif we reinforce each occurrence of the behavior, the definition of continuous reinforcement, we\\ncould also describe this as an FR1 schedule. The number indicates how many responses have to\\nbe made, and in this case, it is one.\\nVariable Ratio schedule (VR) – We might decide to reinforce some varying number of\\nresponses, such as if the teacher gives him an extra credit point after finishing between 40 and 50\\ncorrect problems. This approach is useful if the student is learning the material and does not need\\nregular reinforcement. Also, since the schedule changes, the student will keep responding in the\\nabsence of reinforcement.\\nFixed Interval schedule (FI) – With a FI schedule, you will reinforce after some set amount of\\ntime. Let’s say a company wanted to hire someone to sell their product. To attract someone, they\\ncould offer to pay them $10 an hour 40 hours a week and give this money every two weeks. Crazy\\nidea, but it could work. Saying the person will be paid every indicates fixed, and two weeks is time\\nor interval. So, FI.\\nVariable Interval schedule (VI) – Finally, you could reinforce someone at some changing\\namount of time. Maybe they receive payment on Friday one week, then three weeks later on\\nMonday, then two days later on Wednesday, then eight days later on Thursday, etc. This could\\nwork, right? Not for a job, but maybe we could say we are reinforced on a VI schedule if we are.\\nFinally, four properties of operant conditioning – extinction, spontaneous recovery, stimulus\\ngeneralization, and stimulus discrimination – are important. These are the same four discussed under\\nrespondent conditioning. First, extinction is when something that we do, say, think/feel has not been\\nreinforced for some time. As you might expect, the behavior will begin to weaken and eventually stop\\nwhen this occurs. Does extinction happen as soon as the anticipated reinforcer is removed? The answer\\nis yes and no, depending on whether we are talking about continuous or partial reinforcement. With\\nwhich type of schedule would you expect a person to stop responding to immediately if reinforcement is\\nnot there? Continuous or partial?\\nThe answer is continuous. If a person is used to receiving reinforcement every time they perform a\\nparticular behavior, and then suddenly no reinforcer is delivered, he or she will cease the response\\nimmediately. Obviously then, with partial, a response continues being made for a while. Why is this?\\nThe person may think the schedule has simply changed. ‘Maybe I am not paid weekly now. Maybe it\\nchanged to biweekly and I missed the email.’ Due to this endurance, we say that intermittent or partial\\nreinforcement shows resistance to extinction, meaning the behavior does weaken, but gradually.\\nAs you might expect, if reinforcement occurs after extinction has started, the behavior will re-emerge.\\nConsider your parents for a minute. To stop some undesirable behavior you made in the past, they likely\\ntook away some privilege. I bet the bad behavior ended too. But did you ever go to your grandparent’s\\nhouse and grandma or grandpa—or worse, BOTH—took pity on you and let you play your video games\\n(or something equivalent)? I know my grandmother used to. What happened to that bad behavior that\\nhad disappeared? Did it start again and your parents could not figure out why?'),\n",

The answer is yes, and one of two\\noutcomes is possible. First, the response is made, and nothing happens. In this case, extinction\\ncontinues. Second, the response is made, and a reinforcer is delivered. The response re-emerges.\\nConsider a rat trained to push a lever to receive a food pellet. If we stop providing the food pellets, in\\ntime, the rat will stop pushing the lever. If the rat pushes the lever again sometime in the future and\\nfood is delivered, the behavior spontaneously recovers. Hence, this phenomenon is called spontaneous\\nrecovery.\\n            2.3.2.4. Observational learning. There are times when we learn by simply watching others.\\nThis is called observational learning and is contrasted with enactive learning, which is learning by\\ndoing. There is no firsthand experience by the learner in observational learning, unlike enactive. As you\\ncan learn desirable behaviors such as watching how your father bags groceries at the grocery store (I\\ndid this and still bag the same way today), you can learn undesirable ones too. If your parents resort to\\nalcohol consumption to deal with stressors life presents, then you also might do the same. The critical\\npart is what happens to the person modeling the behavior. If my father seems genuinely happy and\\npleased with himself after bagging groceries his way, then I will be more likely to adopt this behavior. If\\nmy mother or father consumes alcohol to feel better when things are tough, and it works, then I might\\ndo the same. On the other hand, if we see a sibling constantly getting in trouble with the law, then we\\nmay not model this behavior due to the negative consequences.\\nAlbert Bandura conducted pivotal research on observational learning, and you likely already know all\\nabout it. Check out Figure 2.10 to see if you do. In Bandura’s experiment, children were first brought\\ninto a room to watch a video of an adult playing nicely or aggressively with a Bobo doll, which provided\\na model. Next, the children are placed in a room with several toys in it. The room contains a highly\\nprized toy, but they are told they cannot play with it. All other toys are allowed, including a Bobo doll.\\nChildren who watched the aggressive model behaved aggressively with the Bobo doll while those who\\nsaw the gentle model, played nice. Both groups were frustrated when deprived of the coveted toy.\\n \\nFigure 2.10. Bandura’s Classic Experiment'),\n",

Modeling techniques\\nchange behavior by having subjects observe a model in a situation that usually causes them some\\nanxiety.  By seeing the model interact nicely with the fear evoking stimulus, their fear should subside.\\nThis form of behavior therapy is widely used in clinical, business, and classroom situations. In the\\nclassroom, we might use modeling to demonstrate to a student how to do a math problem. In fact, in\\nmany college classrooms, this is exactly what the instructor does. In the business setting, a model or\\ntrainer demonstrates how to use a computer program or run a register for a new employee.\\nHowever, keep in mind that we do not model everything we see. Why? First, we cannot pay attention to\\neverything going on around us. We are more likely to model behaviors by someone who commands our\\nattention. Second, we must remember what a model does to imitate it. If a behavior is not memorable, it\\nwill not be imitated. We must try to convert what we see into action. If we are not motivated to perform\\nan observed behavior, we probably will not show what we have learned.\\n            2.3.2.5. Evaluating the behavioral model. Within the context of psychopathology, the\\nbehavioral perspective is useful because explains maladaptive behavior in terms of learning gone awry.\\nThe good thing is that what is learned can be unlearned or relearned through behavior modification,\\nthe process of changing behavior. To begin, an applied behavior analyst identifies a target behavior, or\\nbehavior to be changed, defines it, works with the client to develop goals, conducts a functional\\nassessment to understand what the undesirable behavior is, what causes it, and what maintains it. With\\nthis knowledge, a plan is developed and consists of numerous strategies to act on one or all these\\nelements – antecedent, behavior, and/or consequence. The strategies arise from all three learning\\nmodels. In terms of operant conditioning, strategies include antecedent manipulations, prompts,\\npunishment procedures, differential reinforcement, habit reversal, shaping, and programming. Flooding\\nand desensitization are typical respondent conditioning procedures used with phobias, and modeling\\narises from social learning theory and observational learning.

This\\nled to a cognitive-behavioral perspective that combines concepts from the behavioral and cognitive\\nmodels, the latter discussed in the next section.\\nCritics of the behavioral perspective point out that it oversimplifies behavior and often ignores inner\\ndeterminants of behavior. Behaviorism has also been accused of being mechanistic and seeing people as\\nmachines. This criticism would be true of behaviorism’s first two stages, though sociobehaviorism\\nsteered away from this proposition and even fought against any mechanistic leanings of behaviorists.\\nThe greatest strength or appeal of the behavioral model is that its tenets are easily tested in the\\nlaboratory, unlike those of the psychodynamic model. Also, many treatment techniques have been\\ndeveloped and proven to be effective over the years. For example, desensitization (Wolpe, 1997)\\nteaches clients to respond calmly to fear-producing stimuli. It begins with the individual learning a\\nrelaxation technique such as diaphragmatic breathing. Next, a fear hierarchy, or list of feared objects\\nand situations, is constructed in which the individual moves from least to most feared. Finally, the\\nindividual either imagines (systematic) or experiences in real life (in-vivo) each object or scenario from\\nthe hierarchy and uses the relaxation technique while doing so. This represents the individual pairings\\nof a feared object or situation and relaxation. So, if there are 10 objects/situations in the list, the client\\nwill experience ten such pairings and eventually be able to face each without fear. Outside of phobias,\\ndesensitization has been shown to be effective in the treatment of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder\\nsymptoms (Hakimian and Souza, 2016) and limitedly with the treatment of depression when co-morbid\\nwith OCD (Masoumeh and Lancy, 2016).\\n \\n2.3.3. The Cognitive Model\\n            2.3.3.1. What is it? As noted earlier, the idea of people being machines, called mechanism,\\nwas a key feature of behaviorism and other schools of thought in psychology until about the 1960s or\\n1970s. In fact, behaviorism said psychology was to be the study of observable behavior. Any reference\\nto cognitive processes was dismissed as this was not overt, but covert according to Watson and later\\nSkinner. Of course, removing cognition from the study of psychology ignored an important part of what\\nmakes us human and separates us from the rest of the animal kingdom. Fortunately, the work of George\\nMiller, Albert Ellis, Aaron Beck, and Ulrich Neisser demonstrated the importance of cognitive abilities\\nin understanding thoughts, behaviors, and emotions, and in the case of psychopathology, show that\\npeople can create their problems by how they come to interpret events experienced in the world around\\nthem. How so?\\n            2.3.3.2. Schemas and cognitive errors. First, consider the topic of social cognition or the\\nprocess of collecting and assessing information about others. So what do we do with this information?\\nOnce collected or sensed (sensation is the cognitive process of detecting the physical energy given off\\nor emitted by physical objects), the information is sent to the brain through the neural impulse. Once in\\nthe brain, it is processed and interpreted. This is where assessing information about others comes in\\nand involves the cognitive process of perception, or adding meaning to raw sensory data. We take the\\ninformation just detected and use it to assign people to categories, or groups. For each category, we\\nhave a schema, or a set of beliefs and expectations about a group of people, presumed to apply to all\\nmembers of the group, and based on experience.\\nCan our schemas lead us astray or be false? Consider where students sit in a class. It is generally'),\n",

Those who sit in the back of the room are underachievers who don’t care. Right? Where\\ndo you sit in class, if you are on a physical campus and not an online student? Is this correct? What\\nabout other students in the class that you know? What if you found out that a friend who sits in the front\\nrow is a C student but sits there because he cannot see the screen or board, even with corrective\\nlenses? What about your friend or acquaintance in the back? This person is an A student but does not\\nlike being right under the nose of the professor, especially if he/she tends to spit when lecturing. The\\nperson in the back could also be shy and prefer sitting there so that s/he does not need to chat with\\nothers as much. Or, they are easily distracted and sits in the back so that all stimuli are in front of\\nhim/her. Again, your schema about front row and back row students is incorrect and causes you to\\nmake certain assumptions about these individuals. This might even affect how you interact with them.\\nWould you want notes from the student in the front or back of the class?\\n            2.3.3.3. Attributions and cognitive errors. Second, consider the very interesting social\\npsychology topic attribution theory, or the idea that people are motivated to explain their own and\\nother people’s behavior by attributing causes of that behavior to personal reasons or dispositional\\nfactors that are in the person themselves or linked to some trait they have; or situational factors that\\nare linked to something outside the person. Like schemas, the attributions we make can lead us astray.\\nHow so? The fundamental attribution error occurs when we automatically assume a dispositional\\nreason for another person’s actions and ignore situational factors. In other words, we assume the\\nperson who cut us off is an idiot (dispositional) and do not consider that maybe someone in the car is\\nseverely injured and this person is rushing them to the hospital (situational). Then there is the self-\\nserving bias, which is when we attribute our success to our own efforts (dispositional) and our failures\\nto external causes (situational). Our attribution in these two cases is in error, but still, it comes to affect\\nhow we see the world and our subjective well-being.\\n            2.3.3.4. Maladaptive cognitions. Irrational thought patterns can be the basis of\\npsychopathology. Throughout this book, we will discuss several treatment strategies used to change\\nunwanted, maladaptive cognitions, whether they are present as an excess such as with paranoia,\\nsuicidal ideation, or feelings of worthlessness; or as a deficit such as with self-confidence and self-\\nefficacy. More specifically, cognitive distortions/maladaptive cognitions can take the following forms:\\nOvergeneralizing – You see a larger pattern of negatives based on one event.\\nMind Reading – Assuming others know what you are thinking without any evidence.\\nWhat if? – Asking yourself ‘what if something happens,’ without being satisfied by any of the\\nanswers.\\nBlaming – You focus on someone else as the source of your negative feelings and do not take any\\nresponsibility for changing yourself.\\nPersonalizing – Blaming yourself for adverse events rather than seeing the role that others play.\\nInability to disconfirm – Ignoring any evidence that may contradict your maladaptive cognition.\\nRegret orientation – Focusing on what you could have done better in the past rather than on\\nimproving now.\\nDichotomous thinking – Viewing people or events in all-or-nothing terms.\\n            2.3.3.5. Cognitive therapies. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI),\\ncognitive behavioral therapy “focuses on exploring relationships among a person’s thoughts, feelings\\nand behaviors. During CBT a therapist will actively work with a person to uncover unhealthy patterns of\\nthought and how they may be causing self-destructive behaviors and beliefs.” CBT attempts to identify'),\n",

They add, “Oftentimes someone being treated with CBT\\nwill have homework in between sessions where they practice replacing negative thoughts with more\\nrealistic thoughts based on prior experiences or record their negative thoughts in a journal.” For more\\non CBT, visit: https://www.nami.org/About-Mental-Illness/Treatments/Psychotherapy. Some commonly\\nused strategies include cognitive restructuring, cognitive coping skills training, and acceptance\\ntechniques.\\nFirst, you can use cognitive restructuring, also called rational restructuring, in which maladaptive\\ncognitions are replaced with more adaptive ones. To do this, the client must be aware of the distressing\\nthoughts, when they occur, and their effect on them. Next, help the client stop thinking these thoughts\\nand replace them with more rational ones. It’s a simple strategy, but an important one. Psychology\\nToday published a great article on January 21, 2013, which described four ways to change your thinking\\nthrough cognitive restructuring. Briefly, these included:\\nNotice when you are having a maladaptive cognition, such as making “negative predictions.”1.\\nFigure out what is the worst thing that could happen and what alternative outcomes are possible.\\nTrack the accuracy of the thought. If you believe focusing on a problem generates a solution, then2.\\nwrite down each time you ruminate and the result. You can generate a percentage of times you\\nruminated to the number of successful problem-solving strategies you generated.\\nBehaviorally test your thought. Try figuring out if you genuinely do not have time to go to the gym3.\\nby recording what you do each day and then look at open times of the day. Add them up and see if\\nmaking some minor, or major, adjustments to your schedule will free an hour to get in some\\nvaluable exercise.\\nExamine the evidence both for and against your thought. If you do not believe you do anything4.\\nright, list evidence of when you did not do something right and then evidence of when you did.\\nThen write a few balanced statements such as the one the article suggests, “I’ve made some\\nmistakes that I feel embarrassed about, but a lot of the time, I make good choices.”\\nThe article also suggested a few non-cognitive restructuring techniques, including mindfulness\\nmeditation and self-compassion. For more on these, visit:\\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/in-practice/201301/cognitive-restructuring\\nThe second major CBT strategy is called cognitive coping skills training. This strategy teaches social\\nskills, communication, assertiveness through direct instruction, role playing, and modeling.  For social\\nskills training, identify the appropriate social behavior such as making eye contact, saying no to a\\nrequest, or starting up a conversation with a stranger and determine whether the client is inhibited\\nfrom making this behavior due to anxiety. For communication, decide if the problem is related to\\nspeaking, listening, or both and then develop a plan for use in various interpersonal situations. Finally,\\nassertiveness training aids the client in protecting their rights and obtaining what they want from\\nothers. Those who are not assertive are often overly passive and never get what they want or are\\nunreasonably aggressive and only get what they want. Treatment starts with determining situations in\\nwhich assertiveness is lacking and developing a hierarchy of assertiveness opportunities. Least difficult\\nsituations are handled first, followed by more difficult situations, all while rehearsing and mastering all\\nthe situations present in the hierarchy. For more on these techniques, visit\\nhttp://cogbtherapy.com/cognitive-behavioral-therapy-exercises/.\\nFinally, acceptance techniques help reduce a client’s worry and anxiety. Life involves a degree of\\nuncertainty, and at times we must accept this. Techniques might include weighing the pros and cons of'),\n",

The disadvantages should outweigh the advantages and help you to end\\nthe struggle and accept what is unknown. Chances are you are already accepting the unknown in some\\nareas of life and identifying these can help you to see why it is helpful in these areas, and how you can\\napply this in more difficult areas. Finally, does uncertainty always lead to a negative end? We may think\\nso, but a review of the evidence for and against this statement will show that it does not and reduce\\nhow threatening it seems.\\n            2.3.3.6. Evaluating the cognitive model. The cognitive model made up for an apparent\\ndeficit in the behavioral model – overlooking the role cognitive processes play in our thoughts, feelings,\\nand behaviors. Right before his death, Skinner (1990) reminded psychologists that the only thing we\\ncan truly know and study was the observable. Cognitive processes cannot be empirically and reliably\\nmeasured and should be ignored. Is there merit to this view? Social desirability states that sometimes\\nparticipants do not tell us the truth about what they are thinking, feeling, or doing (or have done)\\nbecause they do not want us to think less of them or to judge them harshly if they are outside the social\\nnorm. In other words, they present themselves in a favorable light. If this is true, how can we know\\nanything about controversial matters? The person’s true intentions or thoughts and feelings are not\\nreadily available to us, or are covert, and do not make for useful empirical data. Still, cognitive-\\nbehavioral therapies have proven their efficacy for the treatment of OCD (McKay et al., 2015), perinatal\\ndepression (Sockol, 2015), insomnia (de Bruin et al., 2015), bulimia nervosa (Poulsen et al., 2014),\\nhypochondriasis (Olatunji et al., 2014), and social anxiety disorder (Leichsenring et al., 2014) to name a\\nfew. Other examples will be discussed throughout this book.\\n \\n2.3.4. The Humanistic and Existential Perspectives\\n            2.3.4.1. The humanistic perspective. The humanistic perspective, or third force psychology\\n(psychoanalysis and behaviorism being the other two forces), emerged in the 1960s and 1970s as an\\nalternative viewpoint to the largely deterministic view of personality espoused by psychoanalysis and\\nthe view of humans as machines advocated by behaviorism. Key features of the perspective include a\\nbelief in human perfectibility, personal fulfillment, valuing self-disclosure, placing feelings over\\nintellect, an emphasis on the present, and hedonism. Its key figures were Abraham Maslow, who\\nproposed the hierarchy of needs, and Carl Rogers, who we will focus on here.\\nRogers said that all people want to have positive regard from significant others in their life. When the\\nindividual is accepted as they are, they receive unconditional positive regard and become a fully\\nfunctioning person. They are open to experience, live every moment to the fullest, are creative, accepts\\nresponsibility for their decisions, do not derive their sense of self from others, strive to maximize their\\npotential, and are self-actualized. Their family and friends may disapprove of some of their actions but\\noverall, respect and love them. They then realize their worth as a person but also that they are not\\nperfect. Of course, most people do not experience this but instead are made to feel that they can only be\\nloved and respected if they meet certain standards, called conditions of worth. Hence, they experience\\nconditional positive regard. Their self-concept becomes distorted, now seen as having worth only when\\nthese significant others approve, leading to a disharmonious state and psychopathology. Individuals in\\nthis situation are unsure of what they feel, value, or need leading to dysfunction and the need for\\ntherapy. Rogers stated that the humanistic therapist should be warm, understanding, supportive,\\nrespectful, and accepting of his/her clients. This approach came to be called client-centered therapy.'),\n",

This approach stresses the need for people to re-create\\nthemselves continually and be self-aware, acknowledges that anxiety is a normal part of life, focuses on\\nfree will and self-determination, emphasizes that each person has a unique identity known only through\\nrelationships and the search for meaning, and finally, that we develop to our maximum potential.\\nAbnormal behavior arises when we avoid making choices, do not take responsibility, and fail to\\nactualize our full potential. Existential therapy is used to treat substance abuse, “excessive anxiety,\\napathy, alienation, nihilism, avoidance, shame, addiction, despair, depression, guilt, anger, rage,\\nresentment, embitterment, purposelessness, psychosis, and violence. They also focus on life-enhancing\\nexperiences like relationships, love, caring, commitment, courage, creativity, power, will, presence,\\nspirituality, individuation, self-actualization, authenticity, acceptance, transcendence, and awe.” For\\nmore information, please visit: https://www.psychologytoday.com/therapy-types/existential-therapy\\n            2.3.4.3. Evaluating the humanistic and existential perspectives. The biggest criticism of\\nthese models is that the concepts are abstract and fuzzy and so very difficult to research. Rogers did try\\nto investigate his propositions scientifically, but most other humanistic-existential psychologists\\nrejected the use of the scientific method.  They also have not developed much in the way of theory, and\\nthe perspectives tend to work best with people suffering from adjustment issues and not as well with\\nsevere mental illness. The perspectives do offer hope to people suffering tragedy by asserting that we\\ncontrol our destiny and can make our own choices.\\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nAccording to Freud, consciousness had three levels (consciousness, preconscious, and the\\nunconscious), personality had three parts (the id, ego, and superego), personality developed over\\nfive stages (oral, anal, phallic, latency, and genital), there are ten defense mechanisms to protect\\nthe ego such as repression and sublimation, and finally three assessment techniques (free\\nassociation, transference, and dream analysis) could be used to understand the personalities of\\nhis patients and expose repressed material.\\nThe behavioral model concerns the cognitive process of learning, which is any relatively\\npermanent change in behavior due to experience and practice and has two main forms –\\nassociative learning to include classical and operant conditioning and observational learning.\\nRespondent conditioning (also called classical or Pavlovian conditioning) occurs when we link a\\npreviously neutral stimulus with a stimulus that is unlearned or inborn, called an unconditioned\\nstimulus.\\nOperant conditioning is a type of associate learning which focuses on consequences that follow a\\nresponse or behavior that we make (anything we do, say, or think/feel) and whether it makes a\\nbehavior more or less likely to occur.\\nObservational learning is learning by watching others and modeling techniques change behavior\\nby having subjects observe a model in a situation that usually causes them some anxiety.\\nThe cognitive model focuses on schemas, cognitive errors, attributions, and maladaptive\\ncognitions and offers strategies such as CBT, cognitive restructuring, cognitive coping skills\\ntraining, and acceptance.\\nThe humanistic perspective focuses on positive regard, conditions of worth, and the fully\\nfunctioning person while the existential perspective stresses the need for people to re-create\\nthemselves continually and be self-aware, acknowledges that anxiety is a normal part of life,'),\n",

This situation places considerable stress on an\\nindividual and can lead to higher rates of anxiety disorders and depression. Borderline personality\\ndisorder has also been found to be higher in people in low-income brackets (Tomko et al., 2012) and\\ngroup differences for personality disorders have been found between African and European Americans\\n(Ryder, Sunohara, and Kirmayer, 2015).\\n \\n2.4.2. Gender Factors\\nGender plays an important, though at times, unclear role in mental illness. Gender is not a cause of\\nmental illness, though differing demands placed on males and females by society and their culture can\\ninfluence the development and course of a disorder. Consider the following:\\nRates of eating disorders are higher among women than men, though both genders are affected.\\nIn the case of men, muscle dysphoria is of concern and is characterized by extreme concern over\\nbeing more muscular.\\nOCD has an earlier age of onset in girls than boys, with most people being diagnosed by age 19.\\nFemales are at higher risk for developing an anxiety disorder than men.\\nADHD is more common in males than females, though females are more likely to have inattention\\nissues.\\nBoys are more likely to be diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder.\\nDepression occurs with greater frequency in women than men.\\nWomen are more likely to develop PTSD compared to men.\\nRates of SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder) are four times greater in women than men.\\nInterestingly, younger adults are more likely to develop SAD than older adults.\\n \\nConsider this…\\nIn relation to men: “While mental illnesses affect both men and women, the prevalence of mental\\nillnesses in men is often lower than women. Men with mental illnesses are also less likely to have\\nreceived mental health treatment than women in the past year. However, men are more likely to die by\\nsuicide than women, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Recognizing the\\nsigns that you or someone you love may have a mental disorder is the first step toward getting\\ntreatment. The earlier that treatment begins, the more effective it can be.”\\nhttps://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/men-and-mental-health/index.shtml\\n \\nIn relation to women: “Some disorders are more common in women such as depression and anxiety.\\nThere are also certain types of disorders that are unique to women.

When it comes to other\\nmental disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, research has not found differences in the\\nrates at which men and women experience these illnesses. But women may experience these illnesses\\ndifferently – certain symptoms may be more common in women than in men, and the course of the\\nillness can be affected by the sex of the individual. Researchers are only now beginning to tease apart\\nthe various biological and psychosocial factors that may impact the mental health of both women and\\nmen.”\\nhttps://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/women-and-mental-health/index.shtml\\n \\n2.4.3. Environmental Factors\\nEnvironmental factors also play a role in the development of mental illness. How so?\\nIn the case of borderline personality disorder, many people report experiencing traumatic life\\nevents such as abandonment, abuse, unstable relationships or hostility, and adversity during\\nchildhood.\\nCigarette smoking, alcohol use, and drug use during pregnancy are risk factors for ADHD.\\nDivorce or the death of a spouse can lead to anxiety disorders.\\nTrauma, stress, and other extreme stressors are predictive of depression.\\nMalnutrition before birth, exposure to viruses, and other psychosocial factors are potential causes\\nof schizophrenia.\\nSAD occurs with greater frequency for those living far north or south from the equator (Melrose,\\n2015). Horowitz (2008) found that rates of SAD are just 1% for those living in Florida while 9% of\\nAlaskans are diagnosed with the disorder.\\nSource: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/index.shtml\\n \\n2.4.4. Multicultural Factors\\nRacial, ethnic, and cultural factors are also relevant to understanding the development and course of\\nmental illness. Multicultural psychologists assert that both normal behavior and abnormal behavior\\nneed to be understood in the context of the individual’s unique culture and the group’s value system.\\nRacial and ethnic minorities must contend with prejudice, discrimination, racism, economic hardships,\\netc. as part of their daily life and this can lead to disordered behavior (Lo & Cheng, 2014; Jones, Cross,\\n& DeFour, 2007; Satcher, 2001), though some research suggests that ethnic identity can buffer against\\nthese stressors and protect mental health (Mossakowski, 2003). To address this unique factor, culture-\\nsensitive therapies have been developed and include increasing the therapist’s awareness of cultural\\nvalues, hardships, stressors, and/or prejudices faced by their client; the identification of suppressed\\nanger and pain; and raising the client’s self-worth (Prochaska & Norcross, 2013). These therapies have\\nproven efficacy for the treatment of depression (Kalibatseva & Leong, 2014) and schizophrenia (Naeem\\net al., 2015).'),\n",

What is Clinical Assessment?\\nFor a mental health professional to be able to effectively help treat a client and know that the treatment\\nselected worked (or is working), they first must engage in the clinical assessment of the client, or\\ncollecting information and drawing conclusions through the use of observation, psychological tests,\\nneurological tests, and interviews to determine the person’s problem and the presenting symptoms.\\nThis collection of information involves learning about the client’s skills, abilities, personality\\ncharacteristics, cognitive and emotional functioning, the social context in terms of environmental\\nstressors that are faced, and cultural factors particular to them such as their language or ethnicity.\\nClinical assessment is not just conducted at the beginning of the process of seeking help but throughout\\nthe process. Why is that?\\nConsider this. First, we need to determine if a treatment is even needed. By having a clear accounting\\nof the person’s symptoms and how they affect daily functioning, we can decide to what extent the\\nindividual is adversely affected. Assuming a treatment is needed, our second reason to engage in\\nclinical assessment will be to determine what treatment will work best. As you will see later in this\\nmodule, there are numerous approaches to treatment.  These include Behavior Therapy, Cognitive and\\nCognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Humanistic-Experiential Therapies, Psychodynamic Therapies,\\nCouples and Family Therapy, and biological treatments (psychopharmacology). Of course, for any\\nmental disorder, some of the aforementioned therapies will have greater efficacy than others. Even if\\nseveral can work well, it does not mean a particular therapy will work well for that specific client.\\nAssessment can help figure this out. Finally, we need to know if the treatment we employed worked.\\nThis will involve measuring before any treatment is used and then measuring the behavior while the\\ntreatment is in place. We will even want to measure after the treatment ends to make sure symptoms of\\nthe disorder do not return. Knowing what the person’s baselines are for different aspects of\\npsychological functioning will help us to see when improvement occurs.\\nIn recap, obtaining the baselines happens in the beginning, implementing the treatment plan that is\\nagreed upon happens more so in the middle, and then making sure the treatment produces the desired\\noutcome occurs at the end. It should be clear from this discussion that clinical assessment is an ongoing\\nprocess.\\n \\n3.1.2. Key Concepts in Assessment\\nThe assessment process involves three critical concepts – reliability, validity, and standardization. These\\nthree are important to science in general. First, we want the assessment to be reliable or consistent.\\nOutside of clinical assessment, when our car has an issue and we take it to the mechanic, we want to\\nmake sure that what one mechanic says is wrong with our car is the same as what another says, or even\\ntwo others. If not, the measurement tools they use to assess cars are flawed. The same is true of a\\npatient who is suffering from a mental disorder. If one mental health professional says the person\\nsuffers from major depressive disorder and another says the issue is borderline personality disorder,\\nthen there is an issue with the assessment tool being used. Ensuring that two different raters are\\nconsistent in their assessment of patients is called interrater reliability. Another type of reliability\\noccurs when a person takes a test one day, and then the same test on another day. We would expect the\\nperson’s answers to be consistent, which is called test-retest reliability. For example, let’s say the\\nperson takes the MMPI on Tuesday and then the same test on Friday. Unless something miraculous or'),\n",

What does identical mean? The score at test and the score at retest are correlated with\\none another. If the test is reliable, the correlation should be very high (remember, a correlation goes\\nfrom -1.00 to +1.00, and positive means as one score goes up, so does the other, so the correlation for\\nthe two tests should be high on the positive side).\\nIn addition to reliability, we want to make sure the test measures what it says it measures. This is called\\nvalidity. Let’s say a new test is developed to measure symptoms of depression. It is compared against\\nan existing and proven test, such as the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).  If the new test measures\\ndepression, then the scores on it should be highly comparable to the ones obtained by the BDI. This is\\ncalled concurrent or descriptive validity. We might even ask if an assessment tool looks valid. If we\\nanswer yes, then it has face validity, though it should be noted that this is not based on any statistical or\\nevidence-based method of assessing validity. An example would be a personality test that asks about\\nhow people behave in certain situations. Therefore, it seems to measure personality, or we have an\\noverall feeling that it measures what we expect it to measure.\\nPredictive validity is when a tool accurately predicts what will happen in the future. Let’s say we want\\nto tell if a high school student will do well in college. We might create a national exam to test needed\\nskills and call it something like the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT). We would have high school students\\ntake it by their senior year and then wait until they are in college for a few years and see how they are\\ndoing. If they did well on the SAT, we would expect that at that point, they should be doing well in\\ncollege. If so, then the SAT accurately predicts college success. The same would be true of a test such\\nas the Graduate Record Exam (GRE) and its ability to predict graduate school performance.\\nFinally, we want to make sure that the experience one patient has when taking a test or being assessed\\nis the same as another patient taking the test the same day or on a different day, and with either the\\nsame tester or another tester. This is accomplished with the use of clearly laid out rules, norms, and/or\\nprocedures, and is called standardization. Equally important is that mental health professionals\\ninterpret the results of the testing in the same way, or otherwise, it will be unclear what the meaning of\\na specific score is.\\n \\n3.1.3. Methods of Assessment\\nSo how do we assess patients in our care? We will discuss observation, psychological tests, neurological\\ntests, the clinical interview, and a few others in this section.\\n            3.1.3.1. Observation. In Section 1.5.2.1 we talked about two types of observation –\\nnaturalistic, or observing the person or animal in their environment, and laboratory, or observing the\\norganism in a more controlled or artificial setting where the experimenter can use sophisticated\\nequipment and videotape the session to examine it later. One-way mirrors can also be used. A limitation\\nof this method is that the process of recording a behavior causes the behavior to change, called\\nreactivity. Have you ever noticed someone staring at you while you sat and ate your lunch? If you have,\\nwhat did you do? Did you change your behavior? Did you become self-conscious? Likely yes, and this is\\nan example of reactivity. Another issue is that the behavior made in one situation may not be made in\\nother situations, such as your significant other only acting out at the football game and not at home.\\nThis form of validity is called cross-sectional validity. We also need our raters to observe and record\\nbehavior in the same way or to have high inter-rater reliability.'),\n",

The clinical interview. A clinical interview is a face-to-face encounter between a\\nmental health professional and a patient in which the former observes the latter and gathers data about\\nthe person’s behavior, attitudes, current situation, personality, and life history. The interview may be\\nunstructured in which open-ended questions are asked, structured in which a specific set of questions\\naccording to an interview schedule are asked, or semi-structured, in which there is a pre-set list of\\nquestions, but clinicians can follow up on specific issues that catch their attention. A mental status\\nexamination is used to organize the information collected during the interview and systematically\\nevaluates the patient through a series of questions assessing appearance and behavior. The latter\\nincludes grooming and body posture, thought processes and content to include disorganized speech or\\nthought and false beliefs, mood and affect such that whether the person feels hopeless or elated,\\nintellectual functioning to include speech and memory, and awareness of surroundings to include where\\nthe person is and what the day and time are. The exam covers areas not normally part of the interview\\nand allows the mental health professional to determine which areas need to be examined further. The\\nlimitation of the interview is that it lacks reliability, especially in the case of the unstructured interview.\\n            3.1.3.3. Psychological tests and inventories. Psychological tests assess the client’s\\npersonality, social skills, cognitive abilities, emotions, behavioral responses, or interests. They can be\\nadministered either individually or to groups in paper or oral fashion. Projective tests consist of simple\\nambiguous stimuli that can elicit an unlimited number of responses. They include the Rorschach or\\ninkblot test and the Thematic Apperception Test which asks the individual to write a complete story\\nabout each of 20 cards shown to them and give details about what led up to the scene depicted, what\\nthe characters are thinking, what they are doing, and what the outcome will be. From the response, the\\nclinician gains perspective on the patient’s worries, needs, emotions, conflicts, and the individual\\nalways connects with one of the people on the card.  Another projective test is the sentence completion\\ntest and asks individuals to finish an incomplete sentence. Examples include ‘My mother…’ or ‘I hope…’\\nPersonality inventories ask clients to state whether each item in a long list of statements applies to\\nthem, and could ask about feelings, behaviors, or beliefs. Examples include the MMPI or Minnesota\\nMultiphasic Personality Inventory and the NEO-PI-R, which is a concise measure of the five major\\ndomains of personality – Neuroticism, Extroversion, Openness, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness.\\nSix facets define each of the five domains, and the measure assesses emotional, interpersonal,\\nexperimental, attitudinal, and motivational styles (Costa & McCrae, 1992). These inventories have the\\nadvantage of being easy to administer by either a professional or the individual taking it, are\\nstandardized, objectively scored, and can be completed electronically or by hand. That said, personality\\ncannot be directly assessed, and so you do not ever completely know the individual.\\n            3.1.3.4. Neurological tests. Neurological tests are used to diagnose cognitive impairments\\ncaused by brain damage due to tumors, infections, or head injuries; or changes in brain activity.\\nPositron Emission Tomography or PET is used to study the brain’s chemistry. It begins by injecting the\\npatient with a radionuclide that collects in the brain and then having them lie on a scanning table while\\na ring-shaped machine is positioned over their head. Images are produced that yield information about\\nthe functioning of the brain. Magnetic Resonance Imaging or MRI provides 3D images of the brain or\\nother body structures using magnetic fields and computers. It can detect brain and spinal cord tumors\\nor nervous system disorders such as multiple sclerosis. Finally, computed tomography or the CT scan\\ninvolves taking X-rays of the brain at different angles and is used to diagnose brain damage caused by\\nhead injuries or brain tumors.\\n            3.1.3.5. Physical examination. Many mental health professionals recommend the patient see'),\n",

Why is that? Some\\norganic conditions, such as hyperthyroidism or hormonal irregularities, manifest behavioral symptoms\\nthat are like mental disorders. Ruling out such conditions can save costly therapy or surgery.\\n            3.1.3.6. Behavioral assessment. Within the realm of behavior modification and applied\\nbehavior analysis, we talk about what is called behavioral assessment, which is the measurement of a\\ntarget behavior. The target behavior is whatever behavior we want to change, and it can be in excess\\nand needing to be reduced, or in a deficit state and needing to be increased. During the behavioral\\nassessment we learn about the ABCs of behavior in which Antecedents are the environmental events\\nor stimuli that trigger a behavior; Behaviors are what the person does, says, thinks/feels; and\\nConsequences are the outcome of a behavior that either encourages it to be made again in the future\\nor discourages its future occurrence. Though we might try to change another person’s behavior using\\nbehavior modification, we can also change our own behavior, which is called self-modification. The\\nperson does their own measuring and recording of the ABCs, which is called self-monitoring. In the\\ncontext of psychopathology, behavior modification can be useful in treating phobias, reducing habit\\ndisorders, and ridding the person of maladaptive cognitions.\\n            3.1.3.7. Intelligence tests.

Clinical Diagnosis and Classification Systems\\nBefore starting any type of treatment, the client/patient must be clearly diagnosed with a mental\\ndisorder. Clinical diagnosis is the process of using assessment data to determine if the pattern of\\nsymptoms the person presents with is consistent with the diagnostic criteria for a specific mental\\ndisorder outlined in an established classification system such as the DSM-5-TR or ICD-11 (both will be\\ndescribed shortly). Any diagnosis should have clinical utility, meaning it aids the mental health\\nprofessional in determining prognosis, the treatment plan, and possible outcomes of treatment (APA,\\n2022). Receiving a diagnosis does not necessarily mean the person requires treatment. This decision is\\nmade based upon how severe the symptoms are, level of distress caused by the symptoms, symptom\\nsalience such as expressing suicidal ideation, risks and benefits of treatment, disability, and other\\nfactors (APA, 2022). Likewise, a patient may not meet the full criteria for a diagnosis but demonstrate a\\nclear need for treatment or care, nonetheless. As stated in the DSM, “The fact that some individuals do\\nnot show all symptoms indicative of a diagnosis should not be used to justify limiting their access to\\nappropriate care” (APA, 2022).\\nSymptoms that cluster together regularly are called a syndrome. If they also follow the same,\\npredictable course, we say that they are characteristic of a specific disorder.  Classification systems\\nprovide mental health professionals with an agreed-upon list of disorders falling into distinct categories\\nfor which there are clear descriptions and criteria for making a diagnosis. Distinct is the keyword here.\\nPeople suffering from delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking (speech), grossly disorganized or\\nabnormal motor behavior, and/or negative symptoms are different from people presenting with a\\nprimary clinical deficit in cognitive functioning that is not developmental but acquired (i.e., they have\\nshown a decline in cognitive functioning over time). The former suffers from a schizophrenia spectrum'),\n",

The latter can be further\\ndistinguished from neurodevelopmental disorders which manifest early in development and involve\\ndevelopmental deficits that cause impairments in social, personal, academic, or occupational\\nfunctioning (APA, 2022). These three disorder groups or categories can be clearly distinguished from\\none another. Classification systems also permit the gathering of statistics to determine incidence and\\nprevalence rates and conform to the requirements of insurance companies for the payment of claims.\\nThe most widely used classification system in the United States is the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual\\nof Mental Disorders (DSM) which is a “medical classification of disorders and as such serves as a\\nhistorically determined cognitive schema imposed on clinical and scientific information to increase its\\ncomprehensibility and utility. The classification of disorders (the way in which disorders are grouped)\\nprovides a high-level organization for the manual” (APA, 2022, pg. 11). The DSM is currently in its 5th\\nedition Text-Revision (DSM-5-TR) and is produced by the American Psychiatric Association (APA, 2022).\\nAlternatively, the World Health Organization (WHO) publishes the International Statistical\\nClassification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) currently in its 11th edition. We will begin\\nby discussing the DSM and then move to the ICD.\\n \\n 3.2.2. The DSM Classification System\\n            3.2.2.1. A brief history of the DSM. The DSM-5 was published in 2013 and took the place of\\nthe DSM IV-TR (TR means Text Revision; published in 2000). In March 2022, a Text-Revision was\\npublished for the DSM-5, making it the DSM-5-TR.\\nThe history of the DSM goes back to 1952 when the American Psychiatric Association published the\\nfirst edition of the DSM which was “…the first official manual of mental disorders to contain a glossary\\nof descriptions of the diagnostic categories” (APA, 2022, p. 5). The DSM evolved through four major\\neditions after World War II into a diagnostic classification system to be used by psychiatrists and\\nphysicians, but also other mental health professionals. The Herculean task of revising the DSM began in\\n1999 when the APA embarked upon an evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of the DSM in\\ncoordination with the World Health Organization (WHO) Division of Mental Health, the World\\nPsychiatric Association, and the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). This collaboration resulted\\nin the publication of a monograph in 2002 called A Research Agenda for DSM-V. From 2003 to 2008,\\nthe APA, WHO, NIMH, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), and the National Institute on\\nAlcoholism and Alcohol Abuse (NIAAA) convened 13 international DSM-5 research planning conferences\\n“to review the world literature in specific diagnostic areas to prepare for revisions in developing both\\nDSM-5 and the International Classification of Disease, 11th Revision (ICD-11)” (APA, 2022, pg. 6).\\nAfter the naming of a DSM-5 Task Force Chair and Vice-Chair in 2006, task force members were\\nselected and approved by 2007, and workgroup members were approved in 2008. An intensive 6-year\\nprocess of “conducting literature reviews and secondary analyses, publishing research reports in\\nscientific journals, developing draft diagnostic criteria, posting preliminary drafts on the DSM-5 website\\nfor public comment, presenting preliminary findings at professional meetings, performing field trials,\\nand revisiting criteria and text” was undertaken (APA, 2022, pg. 7). The process involved physicians,\\npsychologists, social workers, epidemiologists, neuroscientists, nurses, counselors, and statisticians, all\\nwho aided in the development and testing of DSM-5 while individuals with mental disorders, families of\\nthose with a mental disorder, consumer groups, lawyers, and advocacy groups provided feedback on the'),\n",

The DSM-5 text revision process. In the spring 2019, APA started work on the Text-\\nRevision for the DSM-5. This involved more than 200 experts who were asked to conduct literature\\nreviews of the past 10 years and to review the text to identify any material that was out-of-date. Experts\\nwere divided into 20 disorder review groups, each with its own section editor. Four cross-cutting review\\ngroups to include Culture, Sex and Gender, Suicide, and Forensic, reviewed each chapter and focused\\non material involving their specific expertise. The text was also reviewed by an Ethnoracial Equity and\\nInclusion work group whose task was to “ensure appropriate attention to risk factors such as racism\\nand discrimination and the use of nonstigmatizing language” (APA, 2022, pg. 11).\\nAs such, the DSM-5-TR “is committed to the use of language that challenges the view that races are\\ndiscrete and natural entities” (APA, 2022, pg. 18). Some of changes include:\\nUse of racialized instead of racial to indicate the socially constructed nature of race\\nEthnoracial is used to denote U.S. Census categories such as Hispanic, African American, or\\nWhite\\nLatinx is used in place of Latino or Latina to promote gender-inclusive terminology\\nThe term Caucasian is omitted since it is “based on obsolete and erroneous views about the\\ngeographic origin of a prototypical pan-European ethnicity” (pg. 18)\\nTo avoid perpetuating social hierarchies, the terms minority and non-White are avoided since they\\ndescribe social groups in relation to a racialized “majority”\\nThe terms cultural contexts and cultural backgrounds are preferred to culture which is only used\\nto refer to a “heterogeneity of cultural views and practices within societies” (pg. 18)\\nThe inclusion of data on specific ethnoracial groups only when “existing research documented\\nreliable estimates based on representative samples.” This led to limited inclusion of data on\\nNative Americans since data from nonrepresentative samples may be misleading.\\nThe use of gender differences or “women and men” or “boys and girls” since much of the\\ninformation on the expressions of mental disorders in women and men is based on self-identified\\ngender.\\nInclusion of a new section for each diagnosis providing information about suicidal thoughts or\\nbehavior associated with that diagnosis.\\n            3.2.2.3. Elements of a diagnosis. The DSM-5-TR states that the following make up the key\\nelements of a diagnosis (APA, 2022):\\nDiagnostic Criteria and Descriptors – Diagnostic criteria are the guidelines for making a diagnosis\\nand should be informed by clinical judgment. When the full criteria are met, mental health\\nprofessionals can add severity and course specifiers to indicate the patient’s current presentation.\\nIf the full criteria are not met, designators such as “other specified” or “unspecified” can be used.\\nIf applicable, an indication of severity (mild, moderate, severe, or extreme), descriptive features,\\nand course (type of remission – partial or full – or recurrent) can be provided with the diagnosis.\\nThe final diagnosis is based on the clinical interview, text descriptions, criteria, and clinical\\njudgment.'),\n",

For example, non-rapid\\neye movement (NREM) sleep arousal disorders can have either a sleepwalking or sleep terror\\ntype. Enuresis is nocturnal-only, diurnal-only, or both. Specifiers are not mutually exclusive or\\njointly exhaustive and so more than one specifier can be given. For instance, binge eating\\ndisorder has remission and severity specifiers. Somatic symptom disorder has a specifier for\\nseverity, if with predominant pain, and/or if persistent. Again, the fundamental distinction\\nbetween subtypes and specifiers is that there can be only one subtype but multiple specifiers. As\\nthe DSM-5-TR says, “Specifiers and subtypes provide an opportunity to define a more\\nhomogeneous subgrouping of individuals with the disorder who share certain features… and to\\nconvey information that is relevant to the management of the individual’s disorder” (pg. 22).\\nPrinciple Diagnosis – A principal diagnosis is used when more than one diagnosis is given for an\\nindividual. It is the reason for the admission in an inpatient setting or the basis for a visit\\nresulting in ambulatory care medical services in outpatient settings. The principal diagnosis is\\ngenerally the focus of attention or treatment.\\nProvisional Diagnosis – If not enough information is available for a mental health professional to\\nmake a definitive diagnosis, but there is a strong presumption that the full criteria will be met\\nwith additional information or time, then the provisional specifier can be used.           \\n            3.2.2.4.

Seeking Treatment\\n            3.3.1.1. Who seeks treatment? Would you describe the people who seek treatment as being\\non the brink, crazy, or desperate? Or can the ordinary Joe in need of advice seek out mental health\\ncounseling? The answer is that anyone can. David Sack, M.D. (2013) writes in the article 5 Signs Its\\nTime to Seek Therapy, published in Psychology Today, that “most people can benefit from therapy at\\nleast some point in their lives,” and though the signs you need to seek help are obvious at times, we\\noften try “to sustain [our] busy life until it sets in that life has become unmanageable.” So, when should\\nwe seek help? First, if we feel sad, angry, or not like ourselves. We might be withdrawing from friends\\nand families or sleeping more or less than we usually do. Second, if we are abusing drugs, alcohol, food,\\nor sex to deal with life’s problems. In this case, our coping skills may need some work. Third, in\\ninstances when we have lost a loved one or something else important to us, whether due to death or\\ndivorce, the grief may be too much to process. Fourth, a traumatic event may have occurred, such as\\nabuse, a crime, an accident, chronic illness, or rape. Finally, if you have stopped doing the things you\\nenjoy the most. Sack (2013) says, “If you decide that therapy is worth a try, it doesn’t mean you’re in for\\na lifetime of head shrinking.” A 2001 study in the Journal of Counseling Psychology found that most\\npeople feel better within seven to 10 visits. In another study, published in 2006 in the Journal of\\nConsulting and Clinical Psychology, 88% of therapy-goers reported improvements after just one\\nsession.”\\nFor more on this article, please visit:\\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/where-science-meets-the-steps/201303/5-signs-its-time-seek-ther\\napy\\n            3.3.1.2. When friends, family, and self-healing are not enough. If you are experiencing\\nany of the aforementioned issues, you should seek help. Instead of facing the potential stigma of talking\\nto a mental health professional, many people think that talking through their problems with friends or\\nfamily is just as good. Though you will ultimately need these people to see you through your recovery,\\nthey do not have the training and years of experience that a psychologist or similar professional has.\\n“Psychologists can recognize behavior or thought patterns objectively, more so than those closest to you\\nwho may have stopped noticing — or maybe never noticed. A psychologist might offer remarks or\\nobservations similar to those in your existing relationships, but their help may be more effective due to\\ntheir timing, focus, or your trust in their neutral stance”\\n(http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/psychotherapy-myths.aspx).

What exactly is psychotherapy? According to the APA, in psychotherapy\\n“psychologists apply scientifically validated procedures to help people develop healthier, more effective\\nhabits.” Several different approaches can be utilized to include behavior, cognitive and cognitive-\\nbehavior, humanistic-experiential, psychodynamic, couples and family, and biological treatments.\\n            3.3.1.4. The client-therapist relationship. What is the ideal client-therapist relationship?\\nAPA says, “Psychotherapy is a collaborative treatment based on the relationship between an individual\\nand a psychologist. Grounded in dialogue, it provides a supportive environment that allows you to talk\\nopenly with someone who’s objective, neutral and nonjudgmental. You and your psychologist will work\\ntogether to identify and change the thought and behavior patterns that are keeping you from feeling\\nyour best.” It’s not just about solving the problem you saw the therapist for, but also about learning new\\nskills to help you cope better in the future when faced with the same or similar environmental stressors.\\nSo how do you find a psychotherapist? Several strategies may prove fruitful. You could ask family and\\nfriends, your primary care physician (PCP), look online, consult an area community mental health\\ncenter, your local university’s psychology department, state psychological association, or use APA’s\\nPsychologist Locator Service\\n(https://locator.apa.org/?_ga=2.160567293.1305482682.1516057794-1001575750.1501611950). Once\\nyou find a list of psychologists or other practitioners, choose the right one for you by determining if you\\nplan on attending alone or with family, what you wish to get out of your time with a psychotherapist,\\nhow much your insurance company pays for and if you have to pay out of pocket how much you can\\nafford, when you can attend sessions, and how far you are willing to travel to see the mental health\\nprofessional. Once you have done this, make your first appointment.\\nBut what should you bring? APA suggests, “to make the most of your time, make a list of the points you\\nwant to cover in your first session and what you want to work on in psychotherapy. Be prepared to\\nshare information about what’s bringing you to the psychologist. Even a vague idea of what you want to\\naccomplish can help you and your psychologist proceed efficiently and effectively.” Additionally, they\\nsuggest taking report cards, a list of medications, information on the reasons for a referral, a notebook,\\na calendar to schedule future visits if needed, and a form of payment. What you take depends on the\\nreason for the visit.\\nIn terms of what you should expect, you and your therapist will work to develop a full history which\\ncould take several visits. From this, a treatment plan will be developed. “This collaborative goal-setting\\nis important, because both of you need to be invested in achieving your goals. Your psychologist may\\nwrite down the goals and read them back to you, so you’re both clear about what you’ll be working on.\\nSome psychologists even create a treatment contract that lays out the purpose of treatment, its\\nexpected duration and goals, with both the individual’s and psychologist’s responsibilities outlined.”\\nAfter the initial visit, the mental health professional may conduct tests to further understand your\\ncondition but will continue talking through the issue. He/she may even suggest involving others,\\nespecially in cases of relationship issues. Resilience is a skill that will be taught so that you can better\\nhandle future situations.\\n            3.3.1.5. Does it work? APA writes, “Reviews of these studies show that about 75 percent of\\npeople who enter psychotherapy show some benefit. Other reviews have found that the average person\\nwho engages in psychotherapy is better off by the end of treatment than 80 percent of those who don’t'),\n",

Distinguishing Mood Disorders\\nWithin mood disorders are two distinct groups—individuals with depressive disorders and individuals\\nwith bipolar disorders. The key difference between the two mood disorder groups is episodes of\\nmania/hypomania. More specifically, in bipolar I disorder, the individual experiences a manic episode\\nthat “may have been preceded by and may be followed by hypomanic or major depressive episodes”\\n(APA, 2022, pg. 139) whereas for bipolar II disorder, the individual has experienced in the past or is\\ncurrently experiencing a hypomanic episode and has experienced in the past or is currently\\nexperiencing a major depressive episode. In contrast, individuals presenting with a depressive disorder\\nhave never experienced a manic or hypomanic episode.  \\n \\n4.1.2. Types of Depressive Disorders\\nThe two most common types of depressive disorders are major depressive disorder (MDD) and\\npersistent depressive disorder (PDD). Persistent depressive disorder, which in the DSM-5 now\\nincludes the diagnostic categories of dysthymia and chronic major depression, is a continuous and\\nchronic form of depression. While the symptoms of PDD are very similar to MDD, they are usually less\\nacute, as symptoms tend to ebb and flow over a long period (i.e., more than two years). Major\\ndepressive disorder, on the other hand, has discrete episodes lasting at least two weeks in which\\nthere are substantial changes in affect, cognition, and neurovegetative functions (APA, 2022, pg. 177).\\nIt should be noted that after a careful review of the literature, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, was\\nmoved from “Criteria Sets and Axes Provided for Future Study” in the DSM-IV to Section II of DSM-5 as\\nthe disorder was confirmed as a “specific and treatment-responsive form of depressive disorder that\\nbegins sometime following ovulation and remits within a few days of menses and has a marked impact\\non functioning” (APA, 2022, pg. 177).\\nThe DSM-5 also added a new diagnosis, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD), for\\nchildren up to 12 years of age, to deal with the potential for overdiagnosis and treatment of bipolar\\ndisorder in children, both in the United States and internationally. Children with DMDD present with\\npersistent irritability and frequent episodes of extreme behavioral dyscontrol and so develop unipolar,\\nnot bipolar, depressive disorders or anxiety disorders as they move into adolescence and adulthood.\\nFor a discussion of DMDD, please visit our sister book, Behavioral Disorders of Childhood:\\nhttps://opentext.wsu.edu/behavioral-disorders-childhood/\\n \\n4.1.3.

Mood. While clinical depression can vary in its presentation among individuals, most, if not\\nall individuals with depression will report significant mood disturbances such as a depressed mood for\\nmost of the day and/or feelings of anhedonia, which is the loss of interest in previously interesting\\nactivities.\\n     4.1.3.2. Behavioral. Behavioral issues such as decreased physical activity and reduced\\nproductivity—both at home and work—are often observed in individuals with depression. This is\\ntypically where a disruption in daily functioning occurs as individuals with depressive disorders are\\nunable to maintain their social interactions and employment responsibilities.\\n     4.1.3.3. Cognitive. It should not come as a surprise that there is a serious disruption in cognitions\\nas individuals with depressive disorders typically hold a negative view of themselves and the world\\naround them. They are quick to blame themselves when things go wrong, and rarely take credit when\\nthey experience positive achievements. Individuals with depressive disorders often feel worthless,\\nwhich creates a negative feedback loop by reinforcing their overall depressed mood. They also report\\ndifficulty concentrating on tasks, as they are easily distracted from outside stimuli. This assertion is\\nsupported by research that has found individuals with depression perform worse than those without\\ndepression on tasks of memory, attention, and reasoning (Chen et al., 2013). Finally, thoughts of suicide\\nand self-harm do occasionally occur in those with depressive disorders (Note – this will be discussed in\\nmore detail in Section 4.3).\\n     4.1.3.4. Physical. Changes in sleep patterns are common in those experiencing depression with\\nreports of both hypersomnia and insomnia. Hypersomnia, or excessive sleeping, often impacts an\\nindividual’s daily functioning as they spend the majority of their time sleeping as opposed to\\nparticipating in daily activities (i.e., meeting up with friends or getting to work on time). Reports of\\ninsomnia are also frequent and can occur at various points throughout the night to include difficulty\\nfalling asleep, staying asleep, or waking too early with the inability to fall back asleep before having to\\nwake for the day. Although it is unclear whether symptoms of fatigue or loss of energy are related to\\ninsomnia issues, the fact that those experiencing hypersomnia also report symptoms of fatigue suggests\\nthat these symptoms are a component of the disorder rather than a secondary symptom of sleep\\ndisturbance.\\nAdditional physical symptoms, such as a change in weight or eating behaviors, are also observed.  Some\\nindividuals who are experiencing depression report a lack of appetite, often forcing themselves to eat\\nsomething during the day. On the contrary, others overeat, often seeking “comfort foods,” such as those\\nhigh in carbohydrates. Due to these changes in eating behaviors, there may be associated changes in\\nweight.\\nFinally, psychomotor agitation or retardation, which is the purposeless or slowed physical movement of\\nthe body (i.e., pacing around a room, tapping toes, restlessness, etc.) is also reported in individuals with\\ndepressive disorders.\\n \\n4.1.4.

Major depressive disorder (MDD). According to the DSM-5-TR (APA, 2022), to meet the\\ncriteria for a diagnosis of major depressive disorder, an individual must experience at least five\\nsymptoms across the four categories discussed above, and at least one of the symptoms is either 1) a\\ndepressed mood most of the day, almost every day, or 2) loss of interest or pleasure in all, or most,\\nactivities, most of the day, almost every day. These symptoms must be present for at least two weeks\\nand cause clinically significant distress or impairment in important areas of functioning such as social\\nand occupational. The DSM-5 cautions that responses to a significant loss (such as the death of a loved\\none, financial ruin, and discovery of a serious medical illness or disability), can lead to many of the\\nsymptoms described above (i.e., intense sadness, rumination about the loss, insomnia, etc.) but this may\\nbe the normal response to such a loss. Though the individual’s response resembles a major depressive\\nepisode, clinical judgment should be utilized in making any diagnosis and be based on the clinician’s\\nunderstanding of the individual’s personal history and cultural norms related to how members should\\nexpress distress in the context of loss.\\n     4.1.4.2. Persistent depressive disorder (PDD). For a diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder,\\nan individual must experience a depressed mood for most of the day, for more days than not, for at least\\ntwo years. (APA, 2022). This feeling of a depressed mood is also accompanied by two or more additional\\nsymptoms, to include changes in appetite, insomnia or hypersomnia, low energy or fatigue, low self-\\nesteem, feelings of hopelessness, and poor concentration or difficulty with decision making. The\\nsymptoms taken together cause clinically significant distress or impairment in important areas of\\nfunctioning such as social and occupational and these impacts can be as great as or greater than MDD.\\nThe individual may experience a temporary relief of symptoms; however, the individual will not be\\nwithout symptoms for more than two months during this two-year period.\\n \\nMaking Sense of the Disorders\\nIn relation to depressive disorders, note the following:\\nDiagnosis MDD …… if symptoms have been experienced for at least two weeks  and can be\\nregarded as severe\\nDiagnosis PDD … if the symptoms have been experienced for at least two years    and are not\\nsevere\\n     4.1.4.3. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder. In terms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder, the\\nDSM-5-TR states in the majority of menstrual cycles, at least five symptoms must be present in the final\\nweek before the onset of menses, being improving with a few days after menses begins, and disappear\\nor become negligible in the week postmenses. Individuals diagnosed with premenstrual dysphoric\\ndisorder must have one or more of the following: increased mood swings, irritability or anger,\\ndepressed mood, or anxiety/tension. Additionally, they must have one or more of the following to reach\\na total of five symptoms: anhedonia, difficulty concentrating, lethargy, changes in appetite,\\nhypersomnia or insomnia, feelings of being overwhelmed or out of control, and/or experience breast\\ntenderness or swelling. The symptoms lead to issues at work or school (i.e., decreased productivity and\\nefficiency), within relationships (i.e., discord in the intimate partner relationship or with children,\\nfriends, or other family members), and with usual social activities (i.e., avoidance of the activities).'),\n",

Manic and Hypomanic Episodes\\n     4.2.2.1. Manic episode. The key feature of a manic episode is a specific period in which an\\nindividual reports abnormal, persistent, or expansive irritable mood for nearly all day, every day, for at\\nleast one week (APA, 2022). Additionally, the individual will display increased activity or energy during\\nthis same time.  With regards to mood, an individual in a manic episode will appear excessively happy,\\noften engaging haphazardly in sexual or interpersonal interactions. They also display rapid shifts in\\nmood, also known as mood lability, ranging from happy, neutral, to irritable. At least three of the\\nsymptoms described below (four if the mood is only irritable) must be present and represent a\\nnoticeable change in the individual’s typical behavior.\\nInflated self-esteem or grandiosity (Criterion B1) is present during a manic episode. Occasionally these\\ninflated self-esteem levels can appear delusional. For example, individuals may believe they are friends\\nwith a celebrity, do not need to abide by laws, or even perceive themselves as God. They also engage in\\nmultiple overlapping new projects (Criteria B6 and 7), often initiated with no prior knowledge about the\\ntopic, and engaged in at unusual hours of the day.\\nDespite the increased activity level, individuals experiencing a manic episode also require a decreased\\nneed for sleep (Criterion B2), sleeping as little as a few hours a night yet still feeling rested. Reduced\\nneed for sleep may also be a precursor to a manic episode, suggesting that a manic episode is to begin\\nimminently. It is not uncommon for those experiencing a manic episode to be more talkative than usual.\\nIt can be difficult to follow their conversation due to the quick pace of their talking, as well as tangential\\nstorytelling.  Additionally, they can be difficult to interrupt in conversation, often disregarding the\\nreciprocal nature of communication (Criterion B3). If the individual is more irritable than expansive,\\nspeech can become hostile and they engage in tirades, particularly if they are interrupted or not\\nallowed to engage in an activity they are seeking out (APA, 2022).\\nBased on their speech pattern, it should not be a surprise that racing thoughts and flights of ideas\\n(Criterion B4) also present during manic episodes. Because of these rapid thoughts, speech may\\nbecome disorganized or incoherent. Finally, individuals experiencing a manic episode are distractable\\n(Criterion B5).\\n     4.2.2.2.

A hypomanic episode is like a manic episode in\\nthat the individual will experience abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood\\nand energy levels, however, the behaviors are not as extreme as in mania.

Cyclothymic Disorder\\nNotably, there is a subclass of individuals who experience numerous periods with hypomanic symptoms\\nthat do not meet the criteria for a hypomanic episode and mild depressive symptoms (i.e., do not fully\\nmeet criteria for a major depressive episode). These individuals are diagnosed with cyclothymic\\ndisorder (APA, 2022). Presentation of these symptoms occur for two or more years and are typically\\ninterrupted by periods of normal mood not lasting more than two months at a time. The symptoms\\ncause clinically significant distress or impairment in important areas of functioning, such as social and\\noccupational.

Depressive Disorders\\nStudies exploring depression symptoms among the general population show a substantial pattern of\\ncomorbidity between depression and other mental disorders, particularly substance use disorders\\n(Kessler, Berglund, et al., 2003). Nearly three-fourths of participants with lifetime MDD in a large-scale\\nresearch study also met the criteria for at least one other DSM disorder (Kessler, Berglund, et al.,\\n2003). MDD has been found to co-occur with substance-related disorders, panic disorder, generalized\\nanxiety disorder, PTSD, OCD, anorexia, bulimia, and borderline personality disorder. Gender\\ndifferences do exist within comorbidities such that women report comorbid anxiety disorders, bulimia,\\nand somatoform disorders while men report comorbid alcohol and substance abuse. In contrast, those\\nwith PDD are at higher risk for psychiatric comorbidity in general and for anxiety disorders, substance\\nuse disorders, and personality disorders in particular (APA, 2022).\\nGiven the extent of comorbidity among individuals with MDD, researchers have tried to identify which\\ndisorder precipitated the other. The majority of studies found that most depression cases occur\\nsecondary to another mental health disorder, meaning that the onset of depression is a direct result of\\nthe onset of another disorder (Gotlib & Hammen, 2009).\\n \\n4.4.2. Bipolar Disorders\\nThose with bipolar I disorder typically have a history of three or more mental disorders. The most\\nfrequent comorbid disorders include anxiety disorders, alcohol use disorder, other substance use\\ndisorder, and ADHD, along with borderline, schizotypal, and antisocial personality disorder.\\nBipolar II disorder is more often than not associated with one or more comorbid mental disorders, with\\nanxiety disorders being the most common (38% with social anxiety, 36% with specific phobia, and 30%\\nhaving generalized anxiety). As with bipolar I, substance use disorders are common with alcohol use\\n(42%) leading the way, followed by cannabis use (20%). Premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual\\ndysphoric disorder are common in women with bipolar II disorder especially (APA, 2022).\\nFinally, cyclothymic disorder has been found to be comorbid with substance-related disorders and sleep\\ndisorders.'),\n",

Like with any disorder, researchers often explore the prevalence rate of\\ndepressive disorders among family members to determine if there is some genetic component, whether\\nit be a direct link or a predisposition. If there is a genetic predisposition to developing depressive\\ndisorders, one would expect a higher rate of depression within families than that of the general\\npopulation.

Similarly, there is an elevated prevalence among first-degree relatives for both Bipolar I\\nand Bipolar II disorders as well.\\nAnother way to study the genetic component of a disorder is via twin studies. One would expect\\nidentical twins to have a higher rate of the disorder as opposed to fraternal twins, as identical twins\\nshare the same genetic make-up, whereas fraternal twins only share roughly 50%, similar to that of\\nsiblings. A large-scale study found that if one identical twin was diagnosed with depression, there was a\\n46% chance their identical twin was diagnosed with depression. In contrast, the rate of a depression\\ndiagnosis in fraternal twins was only 20%. Despite the fraternal twin rate still being higher than that of\\na first-degree relative, this study provided enough evidence that there is a strong genetic link in the\\ndevelopment of depression (McGuffin et al., 1996).\\nMore recently, scientists have been studying depression at a molecular level, exploring possibilities of\\ngene abnormalities as a cause for developing a depressive disorder. While much of the research is\\nspeculation due to sampling issues and low power, there is some evidence that depression may be tied\\nto the 5-HTT gene on chromosome 17, as this is responsible for the activity of serotonin (Jansen et al.,\\n2016).\\nBipolar disorders share a similar genetic predisposition to that of major depressive disorder. Twin\\nstudies within bipolar disorder yielded concordance rates for identical twins at as high as 72%, yet the\\nrange for fraternal twins, siblings, and other close relatives ranged from 5-15%. It is important to note\\nthat both percentages are significantly higher than that of the general population, suggesting a strong\\ngenetic component within bipolar disorder (Edvardsen et al., 2008). The DSM-5-TR more recently\\nreports heritability estimates around 90% in some twin studies and the risk of bipolar disorder being\\naround 1% in the general population compared to 5-10% in a first-degree relative (APA, 2022).\\n     4.5.1.2. Biochemical. As you will read in the treatment section, there is strong evidence of a\\nbiochemical deficit in depression and bipolar disorders. More specifically, low activity levels of\\nnorepinephrine and serotonin, have long been documented as contributing factors to developing\\ndepressive disorders. This relationship was discovered accidentally in the 1950s when MAOIs were\\ngiven to tuberculosis patients, and miraculously, their depressive moods were also improved. Soon\\nthereafter, medical providers found that medications used to treat high blood pressure by causing a\\nreduction in norepinephrine also caused depression in their patients (Ayd, 1956).\\nWhile these initial findings were premature in the identification of how neurotransmitters affected the\\ndevelopment of depressive features, they did provide insight as to what neurotransmitters were\\ninvolved in this system. Researchers are still trying to determine exact pathways; however, it does\\nappear that both norepinephrine and serotonin are involved in the development of symptoms, whether it\\nbe between the interaction between them, or their interaction on other neurotransmitters (Ding et al.,\\n2014).\\nDue to the close nature of depression and bipolar disorder, researchers initially believed that both\\nnorepinephrine and serotonin were implicated in the development of bipolar disorder; however, the idea\\nwas that there was a drastic increase in serotonin during mania episodes. Unfortunately, research\\nsupports the opposite. It is believed that low levels of serotonin and high levels of norepinephrine may\\nexplain mania episodes (Soreff & McInnes, 2014). Despite these findings, additional research within\\nthis area is needed to conclusively determine what is responsible for the manic episodes within bipolar\\ndisorder.'),\n",

Endocrine system. As you may know, the endocrine system is a collection of glands\\nresponsible for regulating hormones, metabolism, growth and development, sleep, and mood, among\\nother things. Some research has implicated hormones, particularly cortisol, a hormone released as a\\nstress response, in the development of depression (Owens et al., 2014). Additionally, melatonin, a\\nhormone released when it is dark outside to assist with the transition to sleep, may also be related to\\ndepressive symptoms, particularly during the winter months.\\n     4.5.1.4. Brain anatomy. Seeing as neurotransmitters have been implicated in the development of\\ndepressive disorders, it should not be a surprise that various brain structures have also been identified\\nas contributors to mood disorders. While exact anatomy and pathways are yet to be determined,\\nresearch studies implicate the prefrontal cortex, the hippocampus, and the amygdala. More\\nspecifically, drastic changes in blood flow throughout the prefrontal cortex have been linked with\\ndepressive symptoms. Similarly, a smaller hippocampus, and consequently, fewer neurons, has also\\nbeen linked to depressive symptoms. Finally, heightened activity and blood flow in the amygdala, the\\nbrain area responsible for our fight or flight response, is also consistently found in individuals with\\ndepressive symptoms.\\nAbnormalities in several brain structures have also been identified in individuals with bipolar disorder;\\nhowever, what or why these structures are abnormal has yet to be determined. Researchers continue to\\nfocus on areas of the basal ganglia and cerebellum, which appear to be much smaller in individuals with\\nbipolar disorder compared to the general public. Additionally, there appears to be a decrease in brain\\nactivity in regions associated with regulating emotions, as well as an increase in brain activity among\\nstructures related to emotional responsiveness (Houenou et al., 2011). Additional research is still\\nneeded to determine precisely how each of these brain structures may be implicated in the development\\nof bipolar disorder.\\n \\n4.5.2. Cognitive\\nThe cognitive model, arguably the most conclusive model with regards to depressive disorders, focuses\\non the negative thoughts and perceptions of an individual. One theory often equated with the cognitive\\nmodel of depression is learned helplessness. Coined by Martin Seligman (1975), learned helplessness\\nwas developed based on his laboratory experiment involving dogs. In this study, Seligman restrained\\ndogs in an apparatus and routinely shocked them regardless of their behavior. The following day, the\\ndogs were placed in a similar apparatus; however, this time they were not restrained and there was a\\nsmall barrier placed between the “shock” floor and the “safe” floor. What Seligman observed was that\\ndespite the opportunity to escape the shock, the dogs flurried for a bit, and then ultimately laid down\\nand whimpered while being shocked.\\nBased on this study, Seligman concluded that the animals essentially learned that they were unable to\\navoid the shock the day prior, and therefore, learned that they were helpless in preventing the shocks.\\nWhen they were placed in a similar environment but had the opportunity to escape the shock, their\\nlearned helplessness carried over, and they continued to believe they were unable to escape the shock.\\nThis study has been linked to humans through research on attributional style (Nolen-Hoeksema,\\nGirgus & Seligman, 1992). There are two types of attributional styles—positive and negative. A negative\\nattributional style focuses on the internal, stable, and global influence of daily lives, whereas a positive\\nattributional style focuses on the external, unstable, and specific influence of the environment.'),\n",

This is likely due to their negative interpretation of daily events. For example, if something\\nbad were to happen to them, they would conclude that it is their fault (internal), bad things always\\nhappen to them (stable), and bad things happen all day to them. Unfortunately, this maladaptive\\nthinking style often takes over an individual’s daily view, thus making them more vulnerable to\\ndepression.\\nIn addition to attributional style, Aaron Beck also attributed negative thinking as a precursor to\\ndepressive disorders (Beck, 2002, 1991, 1967). Often viewed as the grandfather of Cognitive-Behavioral\\nTherapy, Beck went on to coin the terms—maladaptive attitudes, cognitive triad, errors in thinking, and\\nautomatic thoughts—all of which combine to explain the cognitive model of depressive disorders.\\nMaladaptive attitudes, or negative attitudes about oneself, others, and the world around them are\\noften present in those with depressive symptoms. These attitudes are inaccurate and often global. For\\nexample, “If I fail my exam, the world will know I’m stupid.” Will the entire world really know you failed\\nyour exam? Not likely. Because you fail the exam, are you stupid? No. Individuals with depressive\\nsymptoms often develop these maladaptive attitudes regarding everything in their life, indirectly\\nisolating themselves from others. The cognitive triad also plays into the maladaptive attitudes in that\\nthe individual interprets these negative thoughts about their experiences, themselves, and their futures.\\nCognitive distortions, also known as errors in thinking, are a key component in Beck’s cognitive\\ntheory. Beck identified 15 errors in thinking that are most common in individuals with depression (see\\nthe end of the module). Among the most common are catastrophizing, jumping to conclusions, and\\novergeneralization. I always like to use my dad (first author’s dad) as an example for overgeneralization.\\nWhenever we go to the grocery store, he always comments about how whatever line he chooses, at\\nevery store, it is always the slowest line. Does this happen every time he is at the store? I’m doubtful,\\nbut his error in thinking leads to him believing this is true.\\nFinally, automatic thoughts, or the constant stream of negative thoughts, also leads to symptoms of\\ndepression as individuals begin to feel as though they are inadequate or helpless in a given situation.\\nWhile some cognitions are manipulated and interpreted negatively, Beck stated that there is another set\\nof negative thoughts that occur automatically. Research studies have continually supported Beck’s\\nmaladaptive thoughts, attitudes, and errors in thinking as fundamental issues in those with depressive\\ndisorders (Lai et al., 2014; Possel & Black, 2014). Furthermore, as you will see in the treatment section\\n(Section 4.5), cognitive strategies are among the most effective forms of treatment for depressive\\ndisorders.\\n \\n4.5.3. Behavioral\\nThe behavioral model explains depression as a result of a change in the number of rewards and\\npunishments one receives throughout their life. This change can come from work, intimate\\nrelationships, family, or even the environment in general. Among the most influential in the field of\\ndepression is Peter Lewinsohn. He stated depression occurred in most people due to reduced positive\\nrewards in their life. Because they were not positively rewarded, their constructive behaviors occurred\\nmore infrequently until they stop engaging in the behavior completely (Lewinsohn et al., 1990; 1984).\\nAn example of this is a student who keeps receiving bad grades on their exam despite studying for\\nhours. Over time, the individual will reduce the amount of time they are studying, thus continuing to'),\n",

Sociocultural\\nIn the sociocultural theory, the role of family and one’s social environment play a substantial role in the\\ndevelopment of depressive disorders. There are two sociocultural views: the family-social perspective\\nand the multi-cultural perspective.\\n     4.5.4.1. Family-social perspective. Similar to that of the behavioral theory, the family-social\\nperspective of depression suggests that depression is related to the unavailability of social support. This\\nis often supported by research studies that show separated and divorced individuals are three times\\nmore likely to experience depressive symptoms than those that are married or even widowed (Schultz,\\n2007). While many factors lead a couple to separate or end their marriage, some relationships end due\\nto a spouse’s mental health issues, particularly depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms have been\\npositively related to increased interpersonal conflicts, reduced communication, and intimacy issues, all\\nof which are often reported in causal factors leading to a divorce (Najman et al., 2014).\\nThe family-social perspective can also be viewed oppositely, with stress and marital discord leading to\\nincreased rates of depression in one or both spouses (Nezlek et al., 2000). While some research\\nindicates that having children provides a positive influence in one’s life, it can also lead to stress both\\nwithin the individual, as well as between partners due to division of work and discipline differences.\\nStudies have shown that women who had three or more young children, and also lacked a close\\nconfidante and outside employment, were more likely than other mothers to become depressed (Brown,\\n2002).\\n     4.5.4.2. Multi-cultural perspective. While depression is experienced across the entire world,\\none’s cultural background may influence what symptoms of depression are presented. Common\\ndepressive symptoms such as feeling sad, lack of energy, anhedonia, difficulty concentrating, and\\nthoughts of suicide are a hallmark in most societies; other symptoms may be more specific to one’s\\nnationality. More specifically, individuals from non-Western countries (China and other Asian countries)\\noften focus on the physical symptoms of depression—tiredness, weakness, sleep issues—and less of an\\nemphasis on the cognitive symptoms.\\nWithin the United States, many researchers have explored potential differences across ethnic or racial\\ngroups in both rates of depression, as well as presenting symptoms of those diagnosed with depression.\\nThese studies continually fail to identify any significant differences between ethnic and racial groups;\\nhowever, one major study has identified a difference in the rate of recurrence of depression in Hispanic\\nand African Americans (Gonzalez et al., 2010). While the exact reason for this is unclear, researchers\\npropose a lack of treatment opportunities as a possible explanation. According to Gonzalez and\\ncolleagues (2010), approximately 54% of depressed white Americans seek out treatment, compared to\\nthe 34% and 40% Hispanic and African Americans, respectively. The fact that there is a large\\ndiscrepancy in the use of treatment between white Americans and minority Americans suggests that\\nthese individuals are not receiving the effective treatment necessary to resolve the disorder, thus\\nleaving them more vulnerable for repeated depressive episodes.\\n            4.5.4.3. Gender differences. As previously discussed, there is a significant difference between\\ngender and rates of depression, with women twice as likely to experience an episode of depression than'),\n",

There are a few speculations as to why there is such an imbalance in the rate\\nof depression across genders.\\nThe first theory, artifact theory, suggests that the difference between genders is due to clinician or\\ndiagnostic systems being more sensitive to diagnosing women with depression than men. While women\\nare often thought to be more “emotional,” easily expressing their feelings and more willing to discuss\\ntheir symptoms with clinicians and physicians, men often withhold their symptoms or will present with\\nmore traditionally “masculine” symptoms of anger or aggression. While this theory is a possible\\nexplanation for the gender differences in the rate of depression, research has failed to support this\\ntheory, suggesting that men and women are equally likely to seek out treatment and discuss their\\ndepressive symptoms (McSweeney, 2004; Rieker & Bird, 2005).\\nThe second theory, hormone theory, suggests that variations in hormone levels trigger depression in\\nwomen more than men (Graziottin & Serafini, 2009). While there is biological evidence supporting the\\nchanges in hormone levels during various phases of the menstrual cycle and their impact on women’s\\nability to integrate and process emotional information, research fails to support this theory as the\\nreason for higher rates of depression in women (Whiffen & Demidenko, 2006).\\nThe third theory, life stress theory, suggests that women are more likely to experience chronic stressors\\nthan men, thus accounting for their higher rate of depression (Astbury, 2010). Women face increased\\nrisk for poverty, lower employment opportunities, discrimination, and poorer quality of housing than\\nmen, all of which are strong predictors of depressive symptoms (Garcia-Toro et al., 2013).\\nThe fourth theory, gender roles theory, suggests that social and or psychological factors related to\\ntraditional gender roles also influence the rate of depression in women. For example, men are often\\nencouraged to develop personal autonomy, seek out activities that interest them, and display\\nachievement-oriented goals; women are encouraged to empathize and care for others, often fostering\\nan interdependent functioning, which may cause women to value the opinion of others more highly than\\ntheir male counterparts do.\\nThe final theory, rumination theory, suggests that women are more likely than men to ruminate, or\\nintently focus, on their depressive symptoms, thus making them more vulnerable to developing\\ndepression at a clinical level (Nolen-Hoeksema, 2012). Several studies have supported this theory and\\nshown that rumination of negative thoughts is positively related to an increase in depression symptoms\\n(Hankin, 2009).\\nWhile many theories try to explain the gender discrepancy in depressive episodes, no single theory has\\nproduced enough evidence to fully explain why women experience depression more than men. Due to\\nthe lack of evidence, gender differences in depression remains one of the most researched topics within\\nthe subject of depression, while simultaneously being the least understood phenomena within clinical\\npsychology.\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:'),\n",

Depressive Disorders\\nGiven that Major Depressive Disorder is among the most frequent and debilitating psychiatric\\ndisorders, it should not be surprising that the research on this disorder is quite extensive. Among its\\ntreatment options, the most efficacious ones include antidepressant medications, Cognitive-Behavioral\\nTherapy (CBT; Beck et al., 1979), Behavioral Activation (BA; Jacobson et al., 2001), and Interpersonal\\nTherapy (IPT; Klerman et al., 1984). Although CBT is the most widely known and used treatment for\\nMajor Depressive Disorder, there is minimal evidence to support one treatment modality over the other;\\ntreatment is generally dictated by therapist competence, availability, and patient preference\\n(Craighhead & Dunlop, 2014).\\n     4.6.1.1. Psychopharmacology – Antidepressant medications. Antidepressants are often the\\nmost common first-line attempt at treatment for MDD for a few reasons. Oftentimes an individual will\\npresent with symptoms to their primary caregiver (a medical doctor) who will prescribe them some line\\nof antidepressant medication. Medication is often seen as an “easier” treatment for depression as the\\nindividual can take the medication at their home, rather than attending weekly therapy sessions;\\nhowever, this also leaves room for adherence issues as a large percentage of individuals fail to take\\nprescription medication as indicated by their physician. Given the biological functions of\\nneurotransmitters and their involvement in maintaining depressive symptoms, it makes sense that this\\nis an effective type of treatment.\\nWithin antidepressant medications, there are a few different classes, each categorized by their\\nstructural or functional relationships. It should be noted that no specific antidepressant medication\\nclass or medication have been proven to be more effective in treating MDD than others (APA, 2010). In\\nfact, many patients may try several different types of antidepressant medications until they find one\\nthat is effective, with minimal side effects.\\n     4.6.1.2. Psychopharmacology – Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). SSRIs are\\namong the most common medications used to treat depression due to their relatively benign side\\neffects. Additionally, the required dose to reach therapeutic levels is low compared to the other\\nmedication options.  Possible side effects from SSRIs include but are not limited to nausea, insomnia,\\nand reduced sex drive.\\nSSRIs improve depression symptoms by blocking the reuptake of norepinephrine and/or serotonin in\\npresynaptic neurons, thus allowing more of these neurotransmitters to be available for postsynaptic\\nneurons. While this is the general mechanism through which all SSRI’s work, there are minor biological\\ndifferences among different types of medications within the SSRI family. These small differences are\\nbeneficial to patients in that there are a few treatment options to maximize medication benefits and\\nminimize side effects.\\n     4.6.1.3. Psychopharmacology – Tricyclic antidepressants. Although originally developed to\\ntreat schizophrenia, tricyclic antidepressants were adapted to treat depression after failing to manage\\nsymptoms of schizophrenia (Kuhn, 1958). The term tricyclic came from the molecular shape of the\\nstructure: three rings.\\nTricyclic antidepressants are like SSRIs in that they work by affecting brain chemistry, altering the\\nnumber of neurotransmitters available for neurons. More specifically, they block the absorption or'),\n",

However, tricyclic antidepressants have been shown to be more effective in treating\\ndepressive symptoms in individuals who have not been able to achieve symptom reduction via other\\npharmacological approaches.\\nWhile the majority of the side effects are minimal – dry mouth, blurry vision, constipation, others can be\\nserious such as sexual dysfunction, tachycardia, cognitive and/or memory impairment. Due to the\\npotential impact on the heart, tricyclic antidepressants should not be used in cardiac patients as they\\nmay exacerbate cardiac arrhythmias (Roose & Spatz, 1999).\\n     4.6.1.4. Psychopharmacology – Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).  The use of MAOIs as\\na treatment for depression began serendipitously as patients in the early 1950s reported reduced\\ndepression symptoms while on the medication to treat tuberculosis. Research studies confirmed that\\nMAOIs were effective in treating depression in adults outside the treatment of tuberculosis. Although\\nstill prescribed, they are not typically first-line medications due to their safety concerns with\\nhypertensive crises. Because of this, individuals on MAOIs have strict diet restrictions to reduce their\\nrisk of hypertensive crises (Shulman, Herrman & Walker, 2013).\\nHow do MAOIs work? In basic terms, monoamine oxidase is released in the brain to remove excess\\nneurotransmitters norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine. MAOIs essentially prevent the monoamine\\noxidase (hence the name monoamine oxidase inhibitors) from removing these neurotransmitters, thus\\nresulting in an increase in these brain chemicals (Shulman, Herman & Walker, 2013). As previously\\ndiscussed, norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine are all involved in the biological mechanisms of\\nmaintaining depressive symptoms.\\nWhile these drugs are effective, they come with serious side effects. In addition to the hypertensive\\nepisodes, they can also cause nausea, headaches, drowsiness, involuntary muscle jerks, reduced sexual\\ndesire, weight gain, etc. (APA, 2010). Despite these side effects, studies have shown that individuals\\nprescribed MAOIs for depression have a treatment response rate of 50-70% (Krishnan, 2007). Overall,\\ndespite their effectiveness, MAOIs are likely the best treatment for late-stage, treatment-resistant\\ndepression patients who have exhausted other treatment options (Krishnan, 2007).\\nIt should be noted that occasionally, antipsychotic medications are used for individuals with MDD;\\nhowever, these are limited to individuals presenting with psychotic features.\\n     4.6.1.5. Psychotherapy – Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT was founded by Aaron Beck\\nin the 1960s and is a widely practiced therapeutic tool used to treat depression (and other disorders as\\nwell). The basics of CBT involve what Beck called the cognitive triangle— cognitions (thoughts),\\nbehaviors, and emotions. Beck believed that these three components are interconnected, and therefore,\\naffect one another. It is believed that CBT can improve emotions in depressed patients by changing both\\ncognitions (thoughts) and behaviors, which in return enhances mood. Common cognitive interventions\\nwith CBT include thought monitoring and recording, identifying cognitive errors, examining evidence\\nsupporting/negating cognitions, and creating rational alternatives to maladaptive thought patterns.\\nBehavioral interventions of CBT include activity planning, pleasant event scheduling, task assignments,\\nand coping-skills training.\\nCBT generally follows four phases of treatment:'),\n",

Similar to behavioral activation (see below), the\\nclinician encourages the patient to identify and engage in activities that are pleasurable to the\\nindividual. The clinician can help the patient to select the activity, as well as help them plan when\\nthey will engage in that activity.\\nPhase 2: Challenging automatic thoughts. During this stage, the clinician provides\\npsychoeducation about the negative automatic thoughts that can maintain depressive symptoms.\\nThe patient will learn to identify these thoughts on their own during the week and maintain a\\nthought journal of these cognitions to review with the clinician in session.\\nPhase 3: Identifying negative thoughts. Once the individual is consistently able to identify\\nthese negative thoughts on a daily basis, the clinician can help the patient identify how these\\nthoughts are maintaining their depressive symptoms. It is at this point that the patient begins to\\nhave direct insight as to how their cognitions contribute to their disorder.\\nPhase 4: Changing thoughts. The final stage of treatment involves challenging the negative\\nthoughts the patient has been identifying in the last two phases of treatment and replacing them\\nwith positive thoughts.\\n     4.6.1.6. Psychotherapy – Behavioral activation (BA). BA is similar to the behavioral component\\nof CBT in that the goal of treatment is to alleviate depression and prevent future relapse by changing an\\nindividual’s behavior. Founded by Ferster (1973), as well as Lewinsohn and colleagues (Lewinsohn,\\n1974; Lewinsohn, Biglan, & Zeiss, 1976), the goal of BA is to increase the frequency of behaviors so that\\nindividuals have opportunities to experience greater contact with sources of reward in their lives. To do\\nthis, the clinician assists the patient by developing a list of pleasurable activities that they can engage in\\noutside of treatment (i.e., going for a walk, going shopping, having dinner with a friend). Additionally,\\nthe clinician assists the patient in identifying their negative behaviors—crying, sleeping in, avoiding\\nfriends—and monitoring them so that they do not impact the outcome of their pleasurable activities.\\nFinally, the clinician works with the patient on effective social skills. By minimizing negative behaviors\\nand maximizing pleasurable activities, the individual will receive more positive reward and\\nreinforcement from others and their environment, thus improving their overall mood.\\n     4.6.1.7. Psychotherapy – Interpersonal therapy (IPT). IPT was developed by Klerman,\\nWeissman, and colleagues in the 1970s as a treatment arm for a pharmacotherapy study of depression\\n(Weissman, 1995). The treatment was created based on data from post-World War II individuals who\\nexpressed a substantial impact on their psychosocial life events. Klerman and colleagues noticed a\\nsignificant relationship between the development of depression and complicated bereavement, role\\ndisputes, role transitions, and interpersonal deficits in these individuals (Weissman, 1995). The idea\\nbehind IPT is that depressive episodes compromise interpersonal functioning, which makes it difficult to\\nmanage stressful life events. The basic mechanism of IPT is to establish effective strategies to manage\\ninterpersonal issues, which in return, will ameliorate depressive symptoms.\\nThere are two main principles of IPT. First, depression is a common medical illness with a complex and\\nmulti-determined etiology. Since depression is a medical illness, it is also treatable and not the patient’s\\nfault. Second, depression is connected to a current or recent life event. The goal of IPT is to identify the\\ninterpersonal problem that is related to the depressive symptoms and solve this crisis so the patient can\\nimprove their life situation while relieving depressive symptoms.\\n     4.6.1.8. Multimodal treatment. While both pharmacological and psychological treatment alone is\\nvery effective in treating depression, a combination of the two treatments may offer additional benefits,\\nparticularly in the maintenance of wellness. Additionally, multimodal treatment options may be helpful'),\n",

With a stepped manner treatment, pharmacological therapy is\\noften used initially to treat depressive symptoms. Once the patient reports some relief in symptoms, the\\npsychosocial treatment is added to address the remaining symptoms. While all three methods are\\neffective in managing depressive symptoms, matching patients to their treatment preferences may\\nproduce better outcomes than clinician-driven treatment decisions.\\n \\n4.6.2. Bipolar Disorder\\n     4.6.2.1. Psychopharmacology. Unlike treatment for MDD, there is some controversy regarding\\neffective treatment of bipolar disorder. One suggestion is to treat bipolar disorder  aggressively with\\nmood stabilizers such as Lithium or Depakote as these medications do not induce pharmacological\\nmania/hypomania. These mood stabilizers are occasionally combined with antidepressants later in\\ntreatment only if absolutely necessary (Ghaemi, Hsu, Soldani & Goodwin, 2003). Research has shown\\nthat mood stabilizers are less potent in treating depressive symptoms, and therefore, the combination\\napproach is believed to help manage both the manic and depressive episodes (Nivoli et al., 2011).\\nThe other treatment option is to forgo the mood stabilizer and treat symptoms with newer\\nantidepressants early in treatment. Unfortunately, large scale research studies have not shown great\\nsupport for this method (Gijsman, Geddes, Rendell, Nolen, & Goodwin, 2004; Moller, Grunze & Broich,\\n2006). Antidepressants often trigger a manic or hypomanic episode in bipolar patients. Because of this,\\nthe first-line treatment option for bipolar disorder  is mood stabilizers, particularly Lithium.\\n     4.6.2.2. Psychological treatment. Although psychopharmacology is the first and most widely used\\ntreatment for bipolar disorders, occasionally psychological interventions are also paired with\\nmedication as psychotherapy alone is not a sufficient treatment option. Majority of psychological\\ninterventions are aimed at medication adherence, as many bipolar patients stop taking their mood\\nstabilizers when they “feel better” (Advokat et al., 2014). Social skills training and problem-solving\\nskills are also helpful techniques to address in the therapeutic setting as individuals with bipolar\\ndisorder often struggle in this area.\\n \\n4.6.3. Outcome of Treatment\\n     4.6.3.1. Depressive treatment. As we have discussed, major depressive disorder has a variety of\\ntreatment options, all found to be efficacious. However, research suggests that while\\npsychopharmacological interventions are more effective in rapidly reducing symptoms, psychotherapy,\\nor even a combined treatment approach, are more effective in establishing long-term relief of\\nsymptoms.\\nRates of relapse for major depressive disorder are often associated with individuals whose onset was at\\na younger age (particularly adolescents), those who have already experienced multiple major depressive\\nepisodes, and those with more severe symptomology, especially those presenting with severe suicidal\\nideation and psychotic features (APA, 2022).'),\n",

A stress disorder occurs when an\\nindividual has difficulty coping with or adjusting to a recent stressor. Stressors can be any\\nevent—either witnessed firsthand, experienced personally, or experienced by a close family\\nmember—that increases physical or psychological demands on an individual. These events are\\nsignificant enough that they pose a threat, whether real or imagined, to the individual. While many\\npeople experience similar stressors throughout their lives, only a small percentage of individuals\\nexperience significant maladjustment to the event that psychological intervention is warranted.\\nAmong the most studied triggers for trauma-related disorders are combat and physical/sexual assault.\\nSymptoms of combat-related trauma date back to World War I when soldiers would return home with\\n“shell shock” (Figley, 1978). Unfortunately, it was not until after the Vietnam War that significant\\nprogress was made in both identifying and treating war-related psychological difficulties (Roy-Byrne et\\nal., 2004). With the more recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, attention was again focused on\\nposttraumatic stress disorder  (PTSD) symptoms due to the large number of service members returning\\nfrom deployments and reporting significant trauma symptoms.\\nPhysical assault, and more specifically sexual assault, is another commonly studied traumatic event.\\nRape, or forced sexual intercourse or other sexual act committed without an individual’s consent,\\noccurs in one out of every five women and one in every 71 men (Black et al., 2011). Unfortunately, this\\nstatistic likely underestimates the actual number of cases that occur due to the reluctance of many\\nindividuals to report their sexual assault. Of the reported cases, it is estimated that nearly 81% of\\nfemale and 35% of male rape victims report both acute stress disorder and posttraumatic stress\\ndisorder symptoms (Black et al., 2011).\\nNow that we have discussed a little about some of the most commonly studied traumatic events, we will\\nnow examine the clinical presentation of posttraumatic stress disorder, acute stress disorder,\\nadjustment disorder, and prolonged grief disorder.\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nA stressor is any event that increases physical or psychological demands on an individual.\\nIt does not have to be personally experienced but can be witnessed or occur to a close family\\nmember or friend to have the same effect.\\nOnly a small percentage of people experience significant maladjustment due to these events.\\nThe most studied triggers for trauma-related disorders include physical/sexual assault and\\ncombat.'),\n",

Clinical Presentation\\n \\nSection Learning Objectives\\nDescribe how PTSD presents.\\nDescribe how acute stress disorder presents.\\nDescribe how adjustment disorder presents.\\nDescribe how prolonged grief disorder presents.\\n \\n5.2.1. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder\\nPosttraumatic stress disorder, or more commonly known as PTSD, is identified by the development of\\nphysiological, psychological, and emotional symptoms following exposure to a traumatic event.\\nIndividuals must have been exposed to a situation where actual or threatened death, sexual violence, or\\nserious injury occurred. Examples of these situations include but are not limited to witnessing a\\ntraumatic event as it occurred to someone else; learning about a traumatic event that occurred to a\\nfamily member or close friend; directly experiencing a traumatic event; or being exposed to repeated\\nevents where one experiences an aversive event (e.g., victims of child abuse/neglect, ER physicians in\\ntrauma centers, etc.).\\nIt is important to understand that while the presentation of these symptoms varies among individuals, to\\nmeet the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD, individuals need to report symptoms among the four different\\ncategories of symptoms.\\n     5.2.1.1. Category 1: Recurrent experiences. The first category involves recurrent experiences of\\nthe traumatic event, which can occur via dissociative reactions such as flashbacks; recurrent,\\ninvoluntary, and intrusive distressing memories; or even recurrent distressing dreams (APA, 2022, pgs.\\n301-2). These recurrent experiences must be specific to the traumatic event or the moments\\nimmediately following to meet the criteria for PTSD. Regardless of the method, the recurrent\\nexperiences can last several seconds or extend for several days. They are often initiated by physical\\nsensations similar to those experienced during the traumatic events or environmental triggers such as a\\nspecific location. Because of these triggers, individuals with PTSD are known to avoid stimuli (i.e.,'),\n",

One or more of the intrusion\\nsymptoms must be present.\\n     5.2.1.2. Category 2: Avoidance of stimuli. The second category involves avoidance of stimuli\\nrelated to the traumatic event and either one or both of the following must be present. First, individuals\\nwith PTSD may be observed trying to avoid the distressing thoughts, memories, and/or feelings related\\nto the memories of the traumatic event. Second, they may prevent these memories from occurring by\\navoiding physical stimuli such as locations, individuals, activities, or even specific situations that trigger\\nthe memory of the traumatic event.\\n     5.2.1.3. Category 3: Negative alterations in cognition or mood. The third category experienced\\nby individuals with PTSD is negative alterations in cognition or mood and at least two of the symptoms\\ndescribed below must be present. This is often reported as difficulty remembering an important aspect\\nof the traumatic event. It should be noted that this amnesia is not due to a head injury, loss of\\nconsciousness, or substances, but rather, due to the traumatic nature of the event. The impaired\\nmemory may also lead individuals to have false beliefs about the causes of the traumatic event, often\\nblaming themselves or others. An overall persistent negative state, including a generalized negative\\nbelief about oneself or others is also reported by those with PTSD. Similar to those with depression,\\nindividuals with PTSD may report a reduced interest in participating in previously enjoyable activities,\\nas well as the desire to engage with others socially. They also report not being able to experience\\npositive emotions.\\n     5.2.1.4. Category 4: Alterations in arousal and reactivity. The fourth and final category\\nis alterations in arousal and reactivity and at least two of the symptoms described below must be\\npresent. Because of the negative mood and increased irritability, individuals with PTSD may be quick-\\ntempered and act out aggressively, both verbally and physically. While these aggressive responses may\\nbe provoked, they are also sometimes unprovoked. It is believed these behaviors occur due to the\\nheightened sensitivity to potential threats, especially if the threat is similar to their traumatic event.\\nMore specifically, individuals with PTSD have a heightened startle response and easily jump or respond\\nto unexpected noises just as a telephone ringing or a car backfiring. They also experience significant\\nsleep disturbances, with difficulty falling asleep, as well as staying asleep due to nightmares; engage in\\nreckless or self-destructive behavior, and have problems concentrating.\\nAlthough somewhat obvious, these symptoms likely cause significant distress in social, occupational,\\nand other (i.e., romantic, personal) areas of functioning. Duration of symptoms is also important, as\\nPTSD cannot be diagnosed unless symptoms have been present for at least one month. If symptoms\\nhave not been present for a month, the individual may meet criteria for acute stress disorder (see\\nbelow).\\n \\n5.2.2. Acute Stress Disorder\\nAcute stress disorder is very similar to PTSD except for the fact that symptoms must be present from 3\\ndays to 1 month following exposure to one or more traumatic events. If the symptoms are present\\nafter one month, the individual would then meet the criteria for PTSD. Additionally, if symptoms present\\nimmediately following the traumatic event but resolve by day 3, an individual would not meet the\\ncriteria for acute stress disorder.'),\n",

PTSD requires symptoms\\nwithin each of the four categories discussed above; however, acute stress disorder requires that the\\nindividual experience nine symptoms across five different categories (intrusion symptoms, negative\\nmood, dissociative symptoms, avoidance symptoms, and arousal symptoms; note that in total, there are\\n14 symptoms across these five categories). For example, an individual may experience several arousal\\nand reactivity symptoms such as sleep issues, concentration issues, and hypervigilance, but does not\\nexperience issues regarding negative mood.

Adjustment Disorder\\nAdjustment disorder is the least intense of the three disorders discussed so far in this module. An\\nadjustment disorder occurs following an identifiable stressor that happened within the past 3 months.\\nThis stressor can be a single event (loss of job, death of a family member) or a series of multiple\\nstressors (cancer treatment, divorce/child custody issues).\\nUnlike PTSD and acute stress disorder, adjustment disorder does not have a set of specific symptoms an\\nindividual must meet for diagnosis. Rather, whatever symptoms the individual is experiencing must be\\nrelated to the stressor and must be significant enough to impair social, occupational, or other important\\nareas of functioning and causes marked distress “…that is out of proportion to the severity or intensity\\nof the stressor” (APA, 2022, pg. 319).\\nIt should be noted that there are modifiers associated with adjustment disorder. Due to the variety of\\nbehavioral and emotional symptoms that can be present with an adjustment disorder, clinicians are\\nexpected to classify a patient’s adjustment disorder as one of the following: with depressed mood, with\\nanxiety, with mixed anxiety and depressed mood, with disturbance of conduct, with mixed disturbance\\nof emotions and conduct, or unspecified if the behaviors do not meet criteria for one of the\\naforementioned categories.

In\\n2018, a proposal was submitted to include this category in the main text of the manual and after careful\\nreview of the literature and approval of the criteria, it was accepted in the second half of 2019 and\\nadded as a new diagnostic entity called prolonged grief disorder. Prolonged grief disorder is defined\\nas an intense yearning/longing and/or preoccupation with thoughts or memories of the deceased who\\ndied at least 12 months ago. The individual will present with at least three symptoms to include feeling\\nas though part of oneself has died, disbelief about the death, emotional numbness, feeling that life is\\nmeaningless, intense loneliness, problems engaging with friends or pursuing interests, intense\\nemotional pain, and avoiding reminders that the person has died.\\nIndividuals with prolonged grief disorder often hold maladaptive cognitions about the self, feel guilt\\nabout the death, and hold negative views about life goals and expectancy. Harmful health behaviors due\\nto decreased self-care and concern are also reported.

Epidemiology\\n \\nSection Learning Objectives\\nDescribe the epidemiology of PTSD.\\nDescribe the epidemiology of acute stress disorder.\\nDescribe the epidemiology of adjustment disorders.\\nDescribe the epidemiology of prolonged grief disorder.\\n \\n5.3.1. PTSD\\nThe national lifetime prevalence rate for PTSD using DSM-IV criteria is 6.8% for U.S. adults and 5.0% to\\n8.1% for U.S. adolescents. There are currently no definitive, comprehensive population-based data\\nusing DSM-5 though studies are beginning to emerge (APA, 2022). It should not come as a surprise that\\nthe rates of PTSD are higher among veterans and others who work in fields with high traumatic\\nexperiences (i.e., firefighters, police, EMTs, emergency room providers). In fact, PTSD rates for combat\\nveterans are estimated to be as high as 30% (NcNally, 2012). Between one-third and one-half of all\\nPTSD cases consist of rape survivors, military combat and captivity, and ethnically or politically\\nmotivated genocide (APA, 2022).\\nConcerning gender, PTSD is more prevalent among females (8% to 11%) than males (4.1% to 5.4%),\\nlikely due to their higher occurrence of exposure to traumatic experiences such as childhood sexual\\nabuse, rape, domestic abuse, and other forms of interpersonal violence. Women also experience PTSD\\nfor a longer duration. (APA, 2022). Gender differences are not found in populations where both males\\nand females are exposed to significant stressors suggesting that both genders are equally predisposed\\nto developing PTSD. Prevalence rates vary slightly across cultural groups, which may reflect differences\\nin exposure to traumatic events. More specifically, prevalence rates of PTSD are highest for African\\nAmericans, followed by Latinx Americans and European Americans, and lowest for Asian Americans\\n(Hinton & Lewis-Fernandez, 2011). According to the DSM-5-TR, there are higher rates of PTSD among\\nLatinx, African-Americans, and American Indians compared to whites, and likely due to exposure to past\\nadversity and racism and discrimination (APA, 2022).\\n \\n5.3.2.

Despite that, it is estimated that anywhere between\\n7-30% of individuals experiencing a traumatic event will develop acute stress disorder (National Center\\nfor PTSD). While acute stress disorder is not a good predictor of who will develop PTSD, approximately\\n50% of those with acute stress disorder do eventually develop PTSD (Bryant, 2010; Bryant, Friedman,\\nSpeigel, Ursano, & Strain, 2010).\\nAs with PTSD, acute stress disorder is more common in females than males; however, unlike PTSD,\\nthere may be some neurobiological differences in the stress response, gender differences in the\\nemotional and cognitive processing of trauma, and sociocultural factors that contribute to females\\ndeveloping acute stress disorder more often than males (APA, 2022). With that said, the increased\\nexposure to traumatic events among females may also be a strong reason why women are more likely to\\ndevelop acute stress disorder.\\n \\n5.3.3. Adjustment Disorder\\nAdjustment disorders are relatively common as they describe individuals who are having difficulty\\nadjusting to life after a significant stressor. In psychiatric hospitals in the U.S., Australia, Canada, and\\nIsrael, adjustment disorders accounted for roughly 50% of the admissions in the 1990s. It is estimated\\nthat anywhere from 5-20% of individuals in outpatient mental health treatment facilities have an\\nadjustment disorder as their principal diagnosis. Adjustment disorder has been found to be higher in\\nwomen than men (APA, 2022).\\n \\n5.3.4. Prolonged Grief Disorder\\nAs this is a new disorder, the prevalence of DSM-5 prolonged grief disorder is currently unknown. Using\\na different definition of the disorder a meta-analysis of studies across four continents suggests a pooled\\nprevalence of 9.8%. It should be noted that these studies could only be loosely compared with one\\nanother making the reported prevalence rate questionable.\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nRegarding PTSD, rates are highest among people who are likely to be exposed to high traumatic\\nevents, women, and minorities.\\nAs for acute stress disorder, prevalence rates are hard to determine since patients must seek\\nmedical treatment within 30 days, but females are more likely to develop the disorder.\\nAdjustment disorders are relatively common since they occur in individuals having trouble\\nadjusting to a significant stressor, though women tend to receive a diagnosis more than men.'),\n",

Biological\\nHPA axis. One theory for the development of trauma and stress-related disorders is the over-\\ninvolvement of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The HPA axis is involved in the fear-\\nproducing response, and some speculate that dysfunction within this axis is to blame for the\\ndevelopment of trauma symptoms. Within the brain, the amygdala serves as the integrative system that\\ninherently elicits the physiological response to a traumatic/stressful environmental situation. The\\namygdala sends this response to the HPA axis to prepare the body for “fight or flight.” The HPA axis\\nthen releases hormones—epinephrine and cortisol—to help the body to prepare to respond to a\\ndangerous situation (Stahl & Wise, 2008). While epinephrine is known to cause physiological symptoms\\nsuch as increased blood pressure, increased heart rate, increased alertness, and increased muscle\\ntension, to name a few, cortisol is responsible for returning the body to homeostasis once the dangerous\\nsituation is resolved.\\nResearchers have studied the amygdala and HPA axis in individuals with PTSD, and have identified\\nheightened amygdala reactivity in stressful situations, as well as excessive responsiveness to stimuli\\nthat is related to one’s specific traumatic event (Sherin & Nemeroff, 2011). Additionally, studies have\\nindicated that individuals with PTSD also show a diminished fear extinction, suggesting an overall\\nhigher level of stress during non-stressful times. These findings may explain why individuals with PTSD\\nexperience an increased startle response and exaggerated sensitivity to stimuli associated with their\\ntrauma (Schmidt, Kaltwasser, & Wotjak, 2013).\\n \\n5.5.2. Cognitive\\nPreexisting conditions of depression or anxiety may predispose an individual to develop PTSD or other\\nstress disorders. One theory is that these individuals may ruminate or over-analyze the traumatic event,\\nthus bringing more attention to the traumatic event and leading to the development of stress-related\\nsymptoms. Furthermore, negative cognitive styles or maladjusted thoughts about themselves and the\\nenvironment may also contribute to PTSD symptoms. For example, individuals who identify life events\\nas “out of their control” report more severe stress symptoms than those who feel as though they have\\nsome control over their lives (Catanesi et al., 2013).\\n \\n5.5.3. Social\\nWhile this may hold for many psychological disorders, social and family support have been identified as\\nprotective factors for individuals prone to develop PTSD.

Sociocultural\\nAs was mentioned previously, different ethnicities report different prevalence rates of PTSD.

Hispanic Americans have routinely been identified as a cultural group that experiences a\\nhigher rate of PTSD. Studies ranging from combat-related PTSD to on-duty police officer stress, as well\\nas stress from a natural disaster, all identify Hispanic Americans as the cultural group experiencing the\\nmost traumatic symptoms (Kaczkurkin et al., 2016; Perilla et al., 2002; Pole et al., 2001).\\nWomen also report a higher incidence of PTSD symptoms than men. Some possible explanations for this\\ndiscrepancy are stigmas related to seeking psychological treatment, as well as a greater risk of\\nexposure to traumatic events that are associated with PTSD (Kubiak, 2006).  Studies exploring rates of\\nPTSD symptoms for military and police veterans have failed to report a significant gender difference in\\nthe diagnosis rate of PTSD suggesting that there is not a difference in the rate of occurrence of PTSD in\\nmales and females in these settings (Maguen, Luxton, Skopp, & Madden, 2012).\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nIn terms of causes for trauma- and stressor-related disorders, an over-involvement of the\\nhypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis has been cited as a biological cause, with rumination\\nand negative coping styles or maladjusted thoughts emerging as cognitive causes.\\nCulture may lead to different interpretations of traumatic events thus causing higher rates among\\nHispanic Americans.\\nSocial and family support have been found to be protective factors for individuals most likely to\\ndevelop PTSD.\\n \\nSection 5.5 Review Questions\\nDiscuss the four etiological models of the trauma- and stressor-related disorders.

Psychological Debriefing\\nOne way to negate the potential development of PTSD symptoms is thorough psychological\\ndebriefing. Psychological debriefing is considered a type of crisis intervention that requires individuals\\nwho have recently experienced a traumatic event to discuss or process their thoughts and feelings\\nrelated to the traumatic event, typically within 72 hours of the event (Kinchin, 2007). While there are a\\nfew different methods to a psychological debriefing, they all follow the same general format:\\nIdentifying the facts (what happened?)1.\\nEvaluating the individual’s thoughts and emotional reaction to the events leading up to the event,2.\\nduring the event, and then immediately following\\nNormalizing the individual’s reaction to the event3.\\nDiscussing how to cope with these thoughts and feelings, as well as creating a designated social4.\\nsupport system (Kinchin, 2007).\\nThroughout the last few decades, there has been a debate on the effectiveness of psychological\\ndebriefing. Those within the field argue that psychological debriefing is not a means to cure or prevent\\nPTSD, but rather, psychological debriefing is a means to assist individuals with a faster recovery time\\nposttraumatic event (Kinchin, 2007). Research across a variety of traumatic events (i.e., natural\\ndisasters, burns, war) routinely suggests that psychological debriefing is not helpful in either the\\nreduction of posttraumatic symptoms nor the recovery time of those with PTSD (Tuckey & Scott, 2014). \\nOne theory is these early interventions may encourage patients to ruminate on their symptoms or the\\nevent itself, thus maintaining PTSD symptoms (McNally, 2004). In efforts to combat these negative\\nfindings of psychological debriefing, there has been a large movement to provide more structure and\\ntraining for professionals employing psychological debriefing, thus ensuring that those who are\\nproviding treatment are properly trained to do so.\\n \\n5.6.2. Exposure Therapy\\nWhile exposure therapy is predominately used in anxiety disorders, it has also shown great success in\\ntreating PTSD-related symptoms as it helps individuals extinguish fears associated with the traumatic\\nevent. There are several different types of exposure techniques—imaginal, in vivo, and flooding are\\namong the most common types (Cahill, Rothbaum, Resick, & Follette, 2009).'),\n",

The\\npatient is then asked to repeatedly discuss the event in increasing detail, providing more information\\nregarding their thoughts and feelings at each step of the event. During in vivo exposure, the individual\\nis reminded of the traumatic event through the use of videos, images, or other tangible objects related\\nto the traumatic event that induces a heightened arousal response. While the patient is re-experiencing\\ncognitions, emotions, and physiological symptoms related to the traumatic experience, they are\\nencouraged to utilize positive coping strategies, such as relaxation techniques, to reduce their overall\\nlevel of anxiety.\\nImaginal exposure and in vivo exposure are generally done in a gradual process, with imaginal exposure\\nbeginning with fewer details of the event, and slowly gaining information over time. In vivo starts with\\nimages or videos that elicit lower levels of anxiety, and then the patient slowly works their way up a fear\\nhierarchy, until they are able to be exposed to the most distressing images. Another type of exposure\\ntherapy, flooding, involves disregard for the fear hierarchy, presenting the most distressing memories\\nor images at the beginning of treatment. While some argue that this is a more effective method, it is\\nalso the most distressing and places patients at risk for dropping out of treatment (Resick, Monson, &\\nRizvi, 2008).\\n \\n5.6.3. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)\\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy, as discussed in the mood disorders chapter, has been proven to be an\\neffective form of treatment for trauma/stress-related disorders. It is believed that this type of treatment\\nis effective in reducing trauma-related symptoms due to its ability to identify and challenge the negative\\ncognitions surrounding the traumatic event, and replace them with positive, more adaptive cognitions\\n(Foa et al., 2005).\\nTrauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) is an adaptation of CBT that utilizes both\\nCBT techniques and trauma-sensitive principles to address the trauma-related symptoms. According to\\nthe Child Welfare Information Gateway (CWIG; 2012), TF-CBT can be summarized via the acronym\\nPRACTICE:\\nP: Psycho-education about the traumatic event. This includes discussion about the event itself, as\\nwell as typical emotional and/or behavioral responses to the event.\\nR: Relaxation Training. Teaching the patient how to engage in various types of relaxation\\ntechniques such as deep breathing and progressive muscle relaxation.\\nA: Affect. Discussing ways for the patient to effectively express their emotions/fearsrelated to the\\ntraumatic event.\\nC: Correcting negative or maladaptive thoughts.\\nT: Trauma Narrative. This involves having the patient relive the traumatic event (verbally or\\nwritten), including as many specific details as possible.\\nI: In vivo exposure (see above).\\nC: Co-joint family session. This provides the patient with strong social support and a sense of\\nsecurity. It also allows family members to learn about the treatment so that they are able to assist\\nthe patient if necessary.\\nE: Enhancing Security. Patients are encouraged to practice the coping strategies they learn in TF-\\nCBT to prepare for when they experience these triggers out in the real world, as well as any'),\n",

Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR)\\nIn the late 1980s, psychologist Francine Shapiro found that by focusing her eyes on the waving leaves\\nduring her daily walk, her troubling thoughts resolved on their own. From this observation, she\\nconcluded that lateral eye movements facilitate the cognitive processing of traumatic thoughts\\n(Shapiro, 1989).\\nWhile EMDR has evolved somewhat since Shapiro’s first claims, the basic components of EMDR consist\\nof lateral eye movement induced by the therapist moving their index finger back and forth,\\napproximately 35 cm from the client’s face, as well as components of cognitive-behavioral therapy and\\nexposure therapy. The following 8-step approach is the standard treatment approach of EMDR (Shapiro\\n& Maxfield, 2002):\\nPatient History and Treatment Planning – Identify trauma symptoms and potential barriers to1.\\ntreatment.\\nPreparation – Psychoeducation of trauma and treatment.2.\\nAssessment – Careful and detailed evaluation of the traumatic event. Patient identifies images,3.\\ncognitions, and emotions related to the traumatic event, as well as trauma-related physiological\\nsymptoms.\\nDesensitization and Reprocessing – Holding the trauma image, cognition, and emotion in4.\\nmind, while simultaneously assessing their physiological symptoms, the patient must track the\\nclinician’s finger movement for approximately 20 seconds. At this time, the patient must “blank it\\nout” and let go of the memory.\\nInstallation of Positive Cognitions – Once the negative image, cognition, and emotions are5.\\nreduced, the patient must hold onto a positive image or thought while again tracking the\\nclinician’s finger movement for approximately 20 seconds.\\nBody Scan – Patient must identify any lingering bodily sensations while again tracking the6.\\nclinician’s fingers for a third time to discard any remaining trauma symptoms.\\nClosure – Patient is provided with positive coping strategies and relaxation techniques to assist7.\\nwith any recurrent cognitions or emotions related to the traumatic experience.\\nReevaluation – Clinician assesses if treatment goals were met. If not, schedules another treatment8.\\nsession and identifies remaining symptoms.\\nAs you can see from above, only steps 4-6 are specific to EMDR; the remaining treatment is essentially a\\ncombination of exposure therapy and cognitive-behavioral techniques. Because of the high overlap\\nbetween treatment techniques, there have been quite a few studies comparing the treatment efficacy of\\nEMDR to TF-CBT and exposure therapy. While research initially failed to identify a superior treatment,\\noften citing EMDR and TF-CBT as equally efficacious in treating PTSD symptoms (Seidler & Wagner,\\n2006), more recent studies have found that EMDR may be superior to that of TF-CBT, particularly in\\npsycho-oncology patients (Capezzani et al., 2013; Chen, Zang, Hu & Liang, 2015). While meta-analytic\\nstudies continue to debate which treatment is the most effective in treating PTSD symptoms, the World\\nHealth Organization’s (2013) publication on the Guidelines for the Management of Conditions\\nSpecifically Related to Stress, identified TF-CBT and EMDR as the only recommended treatment for\\nindividuals with PTSD.'),\n",

Psychopharmacological Treatment\\nWhile psychopharmacological interventions have been shown to provide some relief, particularly to\\nveterans with PTSD, most clinicians agree that resolution of symptoms cannot be accomplished without\\nimplementing exposure and/or cognitive techniques that target the physiological and maladjusted\\nthoughts maintaining the trauma symptoms. With that said, clinicians agree that psychopharmacology\\ninterventions are an effective second line of treatment, particularly when psychotherapy alone does not\\nproduce relief from symptoms.\\nAmong the most common types of medications used to treat PTSD symptoms are selective serotonin\\nreuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; Bernardy & Friedman, 2015). As previously discussed in the depression\\nchapter, SSRIs work by increasing the amount of serotonin available to neurotransmitters. Tricyclic\\nantidepressants (TCAs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are also recommended as second-\\nline treatments. Their effectiveness is most often observed in individuals who report co-occurring major\\ndepressive disorder symptoms, as well as those who do not respond to SSRIs (Forbes et al., 2010).\\nUnfortunately, due to the effective CBT and EMDR treatment options, research on\\npsychopharmacological interventions has been limited. Future studies exploring other medication\\noptions are needed to determine if there are alternative medication options for stress/trauma disorder\\npatients.'),\n",

These symptoms are likely to appear following a significant stressor\\nor years of ongoing stress (i.e., abuse; Maldonadao & Spiegel, 2014).  Occasionally, one may experience\\ntemporary dissociative symptoms due to lack of sleep or ingestion of a substance; however, these would\\nnot qualify as a dissociative disorder due to the lack of impairment in functioning. Furthermore,\\nindividuals who suffer from acute stress disorder and PTSD often experience dissociative symptoms,\\nsuch as amnesia, numbing, flashbacks, and depersonalization/derealization. However, because of the\\nidentifiable stressor (and lack of additional symptoms listed below), they meet diagnostic criteria for a\\nstress disorder as opposed to a dissociative disorder.\\nThere are three main types of dissociative disorders: dissociative identity disorder, dissociative\\namnesia, and depersonalization/derealization disorder.\\n \\n6.1.1. Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID)\\nThe key diagnostic criteria for dissociative identity disorder is the presence of two or more distinct\\npersonality states or an experience of possession (Criteria A). How overt or covert the personality states\\nare depends on psychological motivation, stress level, cultural context, emotional resilience, and\\ninternal conflicts and dynamics (APA, 2022), and severe or prolonged stress may result in sustained\\nperiods of identify confusion/alteration. Those presenting as being possessed by spirits or demons and\\nfor a small proportion of non-possession-form cases, the alternate identifies are readily observable.\\nGenerally, though, the identities in non-possession-form dissociative identity disorder are not overtly\\ndisplayed or only subtly displayed and when they are, it is just in a minority of individuals and manifests\\nas different names, hairstyles, handwritings, wardrobes, accents, etc. If the alternate identities are not\\nobservable, their presence is identified through sudden alterations or discontinuities in the individual’s\\nsense of self and sense of agency, as well as recurrent dissociative amnesias (see the second criteria\\nbelow; APA, 2022).\\nThe second main diagnostic criteria (Criteria B) for dissociative identity disorder is that there must be a\\ngap in the recall of events, information, or trauma due to the switching of personalities. These gaps are\\nmore excessive than typical forgetting one may experience due to a lack of attention. The dissociative\\namnesia presents as gaps in autobiographical memory, lapses in memory of well-learned skills or recent\\nevents, and discovering possessions for which there is no recollection of ever owning, and can involve\\neveryday events and not just events that are stressful or traumatic.\\nIt should be noted that most possession states occurring around the world are part of broadly accepted\\ncultural or religious practice and should not be diagnosed as dissociative identity disorder (Criteria D).\\nThe possession-form identities in dissociative identity disorder manifest most often as a spirit or\\nsupernatural being taking control and the individual speaking or acting in a distinctly different way.\\nThese identities present recurrently, are involuntary and unwanted, and cause significant distress or\\nimpairment (Criteria C). Impairment varies in adults from minimal (i.e., high functioning professionals)\\nto profound. For those minimally affected, marital, family, relational, and parenting functions are more\\nlikely to be impaired by symptoms of dissociative identity disorder rather than their occupational and\\nprofessional life.'),\n",

From there, an individual may have several subpersonalities. Although it is\\nhard to identify how many subpersonalities an individual may have at one time, it is believed that there\\nare on average 15 subpersonalities for women and 8 for men (APA, 2000).\\nThe switching or shifting between personalities varies among individuals and can range from merely\\nappearing to fall asleep, to very dramatic, involving excessive bodily movements, though for most, the\\nchange is subtle and may occur with only subtle changes in overt presentation. When sudden and\\nunexpected, switching is generally precipitated by a significant stressor, as the subpersonality best\\nequipped to handle the current stressor will present. The relationship between subpersonalities varies\\nbetween individuals, with some individuals reporting knowledge of other subpersonalities while others\\nhave a one-way amnesic relationship with subpersonalities, meaning they are not aware of other\\npersonalities (Barlow & Chu, 2014). These individuals will experience episodes of “amnesia” when the\\nprimary personality is not present.\\n \\n6.1.2. Dissociative Amnesia\\nDissociative amnesia is identified by the inability to recall important autobiographical information,\\nusually of a traumatic or stressful nature. It often consists of selective amnesia for a specific event or\\nevents or generalized amnesia for identity and life history. This type of amnesia is different from what\\none would consider permanent amnesia in that the information was successfully stored in memory but\\ncannot be freely recollected. It is conceptualized as possibly being a reversible memory retrieval deficit.\\nAdditionally, individuals experiencing permanent amnesia often have a neurobiological cause, whereas\\ndissociative amnesia does not (APA, 2022).\\nThere are a few types of amnesia within dissociative amnesia. Localized amnesia, the most common\\ntype, is the inability to recall events during a specific period. The length of time within a localized\\namnesia episode can vary—it can be as short as the time immediately surrounding a traumatic event, to\\nmonths or years, should the traumatic event occur that long (as commonly seen in abuse and combat\\nsituations). Selective amnesia is, in a sense, a component of localized amnesia in that the individual\\ncan recall some, but not all, of the details during a specific period. For example, a soldier may\\nexperience dissociative amnesia during the time they were deployed, yet still have some memories of\\npositive experiences such as celebrating Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner with the members of their\\nunit. Systematized amnesia occurs when an individual fails to recall a specific category of information\\nsuch as not recalling a specific room in their childhood home.\\nConversely, some individuals experience generalized dissociative amnesia in which they have a\\ncomplete loss of memory for most or all of their life history, including their own identity, previous\\nknowledge about the world, and/or well-learned skills. Individuals who experience this amnesia\\nexperience deficits in both semantic and procedural knowledge. This means that individuals have no\\ncommon knowledge of (i.e., cannot identify letters, colors, numbers) nor can they engage in learned\\nskills (i.e., typing shoes, driving car). While generalized dissociative amnesia is extremely rare, it is also\\nextremely frightening. The onset is acute, and the individual is often found wandering in a state of\\ndisorientation. Many times, these individuals are brought into emergency rooms by law enforcement\\nfollowing a dangerous situation such as an individual wandering on a busy road.\\nThe distress and impairment suffered by those with dissociative amnesia resulting from'),\n",

Some are chronically impaired in their ability to form and\\nsustain satisfactory attachments while others are highly successful in their occupation due to\\ncompulsive overwork. And finally, a substantial subgroup of those afflicted by generalized dissociative\\namnesia develop a highly impairing, chronic autobiographical memory deficit that is not ameliorated by\\nrelearning their life history, resulting in poor overall functioning in most life domains (APA, 2022).\\n \\n6.1.3. Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder\\nDepersonalization/derealization disorder is categorized by recurrent episodes of depersonalization\\nand/or derealization. Depersonalization can be defined as a feeling of unreality or detachment from\\noneself. Individuals describe this feeling as an out-of-body experience where you are an observer of\\nyour thoughts, feelings, and physical being. Furthermore, some patients report feeling as though they\\nlack speech or motor control, thus feeling at times like a robot. Distortions of one’s physical body have\\nalso been reported, with various body parts appearing enlarged or shrunken. Emotionally, one may feel\\ndetached from their feelings, lacking the ability to feel emotions despite knowing they have them.\\nSymptoms of derealization include feelings of unreality or detachment from the world—whether it be\\nindividuals, objects, or their surroundings. For example, an individual may feel as though they are\\nunfamiliar with their surroundings, even though they are in a place they have been to many times\\nbefore. Feeling emotionally disconnected from close friends or family members whom they have strong\\nfeelings for is another common symptom experienced during derealization episodes. Sensory changes\\nhave also been reported, such as feeling as though your environment is distorted, blurry, or even\\nartificial. Distortions of time, distance, and size/shape of objects may also occur.\\nThese episodes can last anywhere from a few hours to days, weeks, or even months. The onset is\\ngenerally sudden, and like the other dissociative disorders, is often triggered by intense stress or\\ntrauma. Many individuals describe feeling like they are “crazy” or “going crazy” and fear they have\\nirreversible brain damage. They experience an altered sense of time and may be obsessed about\\nwhether they really exist.\\nAs one can imagine, depersonalization/derealization disorder can cause significant emotional distress,\\nas well as impairment in one’s daily functioning. The disorder is associated with major morbidity and\\nimpairment occurs in both interpersonal and occupational spheres due to “…the hypoemotionality with\\nothers, subjective difficulty in focusing and retaining information, and a general sense of\\ndisconnectedness form life” (APA, 2022).\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nDissociative disorders are characterized by disruption in consciousness, memory, identity,\\nemotion, perception, motor control, or behavior.

Similarly, depressive disorders are also\\ncommonly found in combination with dissociative disorders, likely due to the impact the disorders have\\non social and emotional functioning. In individuals with dissociative amnesia, a wide range of emotions\\nrelated to their inability to recall memories during the episode often present once the amnesia episode\\nis in remission (APA, 2022). These emotions frequently contribute to the development of a depressive\\nepisode.\\nThere has been some evidence of comorbid somatic symptom disorder and conversion disorder,\\nparticularly for those who experience dissociative amnesia.

More specifically, Kopelman (2000) theorizes that the combination of psychological\\nstress and various other biopsychosocial predispositions affects the frontal lobes executive system’s\\nability to retrieve autobiographical memories (Picard et al., 2013). Neuroimaging studies have\\nsupported this theory by showing deficits to several prefrontal regions, which is one area responsible\\nfor memory retrieval (Picard et al., 2013).   Despite these findings, there is still some debate over which\\nspecific brain regions within the executive system are responsible for the retrieval difficulties, as\\nresearch studies have reported mixed findings.\\nSpecific to dissociative identity disorder, neuroimaging studies have shown differences in hippocampus\\nactivation between subpersonalities (Tsai, Condie, Wu & Chang, 1999). As you may recall, the\\nhippocampus is responsible for storing information from short-term to long-term memory. It is\\nhypothesized that this brain region is responsible for the generation of dissociative states and amnesia\\n(Staniloiu & Markowitsch, 2010).\\n \\n6.4.3. Sociocultural\\nThe sociocultural model of dissociative disorders has been primarily influenced by Lilienfeld and\\ncolleagues (1999) who argue that the influence of mass media and its publications of dissociative\\ndisorders, provide a model for individuals to not only learn about dissociative disorders but also engage\\nin similar dissociative behaviors. This theory has been supported by the significant increase in\\ndissociative identity disorder cases after the publication of Sybil, a documentation of a woman’s 16\\nsubpersonalities (Goff & Simms, 1993).\\nThese mass media productions are not just suggestive to patients. It has been suggested that mass\\nmedia also influences the way clinicians gather information regarding dissociative symptoms of\\npatients. For example, therapists may unconsciously use questions or techniques in session that evoke\\ndissociative types of problems in their patient following exposure to a media source discussing\\ndissociative disorders.\\n   \\n6.4.4. Psychodynamic\\nThe psychodynamic theory of dissociative disorders assumes that dissociative disorders are caused by\\nan individual’s repressed thoughts and feelings related to an unpleasant or traumatic event\\n(Richardson, 1998). In blocking these thoughts and feelings, the individual is subconsciously protecting\\nhimself from painful memories.\\nWhile a single incidence of repression may explain dissociative amnesia, psychodynamic theorists\\nbelieve that dissociative identity disorder results from repeated exposure to traumatic experiences,\\nsuch as childhood abuse, neglect, or abandonment (Dalenberg et al., 2012). According to the\\npsychodynamic perspective, children who experience repeated traumatic events such as physical abuse\\nor parental neglect lack the support and resources to cope with these experiences. To escape from their\\ncurrent situation, children develop different personalities to essentially flee the dangerous situation\\nthey are in. While there is limited scientific evidence to support this theory, the nature of severe\\nchildhood psychological trauma is consistent with this theory, as individuals with dissociative identity'),\n",

Integration refers to the ongoing process of merging\\nsubpersonalities into one personality. Psychoeducation is paramount for integration, as the individual\\nmust understand their disorder, as well as acknowledge their subpersonalities. As mentioned above,\\nmany individuals have a one-way amnesic relationship with the subpersonalities, meaning they are not\\naware of one another. Therefore, the clinician must first make the individual aware of the various\\nsubpersonalities that present across different situations.\\nAchieving integration requires several steps. First, the clinician needs to build a relationship and strong\\nrapport with the primary personality. From there, the clinician can begin to encourage communication\\nand coordination between the subpersonalities gradually. Making the subpersonalities aware of one\\nanother, as well as addressing their conflicts, is an essential component of the integration of\\nsubpersonalities, and the core of dissociative identity disorder treatment (Chu et al., 2011).\\nOnce the individual is aware of their personalities, treatment can continue with the goal of fusion.\\nFusion occurs when two or more alternate identities join (Chu et al., 2011). When this happens, there is\\na complete loss of separateness. Depending on the number of subpersonalities, this process can take\\nquite a while. Once all subpersonalities are fused and the individual identifies themselves as one unified\\nself, it is believed the patient has reached final fusion.\\nIt should be noted that final fusion is difficult to obtain. As you can imagine, some patients do not find\\nfinal fusion a desirable outcome, particularly those with harrowing histories; chronic, severe stressors;\\nadvanced age; and comorbid medical and psychiatric disorders, to name a few. For individuals where\\nfinal fusion is not the treatment goal, the clinician may work toward resolution or sufficient integration\\nand coordination of subpersonalities that allows the individual to function independently (Chu et al.,\\n2011). Unfortunately, individuals that do not achieve final fusion are at greater risk for relapse of\\nsymptoms, particularly those with whose dissociative identity disorder appears to stem from traumatic\\nexperiences.\\nOnce an individual reaches final fusion, ongoing treatment is essential to maintain this status. In\\ngeneral, treatment focuses on social and positive coping skills. These skills are particularly helpful for\\nindividuals with a history of traumatic events, as it can help them process these events, as well as help\\nprevent future relapses.\\n \\n6.5.2. Dissociative Amnesia\\nAs previously mentioned, many individuals regain memory without the need for treatment; however,\\nthere is a small population that does require additional treatment. While there is no evidenced-based\\ntreatment for dissociative amnesia, both hypnosis and phasic therapy have been shown to produce some'),\n",

Hypnosis. One theory of dissociative amnesia is that it is a form of self-hypnosis and that\\nindividuals hypnotize themselves to forget information or events that are unpleasant (Dell, 2010).\\nBecause of this theory, one type of treatment that has routinely been implemented for individuals with\\ndissociative amnesia is hypnosis. Through hypnosis, the clinician can help the individual contain,\\nmodulate, and reduce the intensity of the amnesia symptoms, thus allowing them to process the\\ntraumatic or unpleasant events underlying the amnesia episode (Maldonadao & Spiegel, 2014). To do\\nthis, the clinician will encourage the patient to think of memories just before the amnesic episode as\\nthough it was the present time. The clinician will then slowly walk them through the events during the\\namnesic period to reorient the individual to experience these events. This technique is essentially a way\\nto encourage a controlled recall of dissociated memories, something that is particularly helpful when\\nthe memories include traumatic experiences (Maldonadao & Spiegel, 2014).\\nAnother form of “hypnosis” is the use of barbiturates, also known as “truth serums,” to help relax the\\nindividual and free their inhibitions. Although not always effective, the theory is that these drugs reduce\\nthe anxiety surrounding the unpleasant events enough to allow the individual to recall and process\\nthese memories in a safe environment (Ahern et al., 2000).\\n \\n6.5.3. Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder\\nDepersonalization/derealization disorder symptoms generally occur for an extensive period before the\\nindividual seeks out treatment. Because of this, there is some evidence to support that the diagnosis\\nalone is effective in reducing symptom intensity, as it also relieves the individual’s anxiety surrounding\\nthe baffling nature of the symptoms (Medford, Sierra, Baker, & David, 2005).\\nDue to the high comorbidity of depersonalization/derealization disorder with anxiety and depression,\\nthe goal of treatment is often alleviating these secondary mental health symptoms related to the\\ndepersonalization/derealization symptoms. While there has been some evidence to suggest treatment\\nwith an SSRI is effective in improving mood, the evidence for a combined treatment method of\\npsychopharmacological and psychological treatment is even more compelling (Medford, Sierra, Baker,\\n& David, 2005). The psychological treatment of preference is cognitive-behavioral therapy as it\\naddresses the negative attributions and appraisals contributing to the depersonalization/derealization\\nsymptoms (Medford, Sierra, Baker, & David, 2005). By challenging these catastrophic attributions in\\nresponse to stressful situations, the individual can reduce overall anxiety levels, which consequently\\nreduces depersonalization/ derealization symptoms.\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nTreatment for dissociative identity disorder involves the integration of subpersonalities to the\\npoint of final fusion and takes several steps to achieve.\\nFor some patients, this is not possible as they do not find final fusion to be a desirable outcome.'),\n",

How do we distinguish fear from anxiety? The DSM says that fear is an\\nemotional response to a real or perceived imminent threat which leads to “…surges of autonomic\\narousal necessary for flight or flight, thoughts of immediate danger, and escape behaviors.” Anxiety, on\\nthe other hand, is the anticipation of a future threat leading to, “…muscle tension and vigilance in\\npreparation for future danger and cautious or avoidant behaviors” (APA, 2022, pg. 215). The anxiety\\ndisorders differ from one another in the types of objects or situations that lead to fear, anxiety, or\\navoidance behavior. We will cover generalized anxiety disorder, specific phobia, agoraphobia, social\\nanxiety disorder, and panic disorder.\\n \\n7.1.1. Generalized Anxiety Disorder\\nGeneralized anxiety disorder is characterized by an underlying excessive anxiety and worry related\\nto a wide range of events or activities and lasting for more days than not for at least six months. While\\nmany individuals experience some degree of worry throughout the day, individuals with generalized\\nanxiety disorder experience worry of greater intensity and for longer periods than the average person\\n(APA, 2022). Additionally, they are often unable to control their worry through various coping\\nstrategies, which directly interferes with their ability to engage in daily social and occupational tasks.\\nTo receive a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder, three or more of the following somatic symptoms\\nmust be present in adults as well: restlessness, fatigue, difficultly concentrating, irritability, muscle\\ntension, and problems sleeping (APA, 2022; Gelenberg, 2000).\\n \\n7.1.2. Specific Phobia\\nSpecific phobia is distinguished by fear or anxiety specific to an object or a situation. While the\\namount of fear or anxiety related to the specific object or situation varies among individuals, it also\\nvaries related to the proximity of the object or situation. When individuals are face-to-face with their\\nspecific phobia, immediate fear is present, and the phobic object or situation is actively avoided or\\nendured. It should also be noted that these fears are excessive and irrational, often severely impacting\\none’s daily functioning. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, lasting at least six months (APA,\\n2022).\\nIndividuals can experience multiple specific phobias at the same time. In fact, nearly 75% of individuals\\nwith a specific phobia report fear of more than one object and the average individual fears three or\\nmore objects or situations (APA, 2022).  When making a diagnosis of specific phobia, it is important to\\nidentify the stimulus. Among the most diagnosed specific phobias are animals, natural environment\\n(height, storms, water), blood-injection-injury (needles, invasive medical procedures), or situational\\n(airplanes, elevators, enclosed places). In terms of gender differences, women predominantly\\nexperience animal, natural environment, and situational specific phobias while blood-injection-injury\\nphobia is experienced by both men and women equally (APA, 2022).'),\n",

Agoraphobia\\nAgoraphobia is defined as intense fear or anxiety triggered by two or more of the following: using\\npublic transportation such as planes, trains, ships, buses; being in large, open spaces such as parking\\nlots or on bridges; being in enclosed spaces like stores or movie theaters; being in a crowd or standing\\nin line; or being outside of the home alone. The individual fears or avoids these situations because they\\nbelieve something terrible may occur and due to concern over not being able to escape or help not\\nbeing available (APA, 2022). Active avoidance of the situations occurs and can be behavioral such as\\nchanging daily routines or using delivery to avoid entering a restaurant or cognitive such as using\\ndistraction to bear with an agoraphobic situation. The avoidance can result in the person being\\nhomebound. The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger they pose and has been\\npresent for at least six months.\\n \\n7.1.4. Social Anxiety Disorder\\nFor social anxiety disorder, the anxiety or fear relates to social situations, particularly those in which\\nan individual can be evaluated by others. More specifically, the individual is worried that they will be\\njudged negatively and viewed as stupid, anxious, crazy, boring, or unlikeable, to name a few. Some\\nindividuals report feeling concerned that their anxiety symptoms will be obvious to others via blushing,\\nstuttering, sweating, trembling, etc. These fears severely limit an individual’s behavior in social settings\\nand have occurred for six months or more.\\nTo explain social anxiety in greater detail, let’s review the story of Mary. Mary reported the onset of her\\nsocial anxiety disorder in early elementary school when teachers would call on students to read parts of\\ntheir textbook aloud. Mary stated that she was fearful of making mistakes while reading and to alleviate\\nthis anxiety, she would read several sections ahead of the class to prepare for her turn to read aloud.\\nDespite her preparedness, one day in 5th grade, Mary was called to read, and she stumbled on a few\\nwords. While none of her classmates realized her mistake, Mary was extremely embarrassed and\\nreported higher levels of anxiety during future read aloud moments in school. In fact, when she was\\ncalled upon, Mary stated she would completely freeze up and not talk at all. After a few moments of not\\nspeaking, her teacher would skip Mary and ask another student to read her section. It took several\\nyears and a very supportive teacher for Mary to begin reading aloud in class again.\\nLike Mary, individuals with social anxiety disorder report that all or nearly all social situations provoke\\nthis intense fear. Some individuals even report significant anticipatory fear days or weeks before a\\nsocial event is to occur. This anticipatory fear often leads to avoidance of social events in some\\nindividuals; others will attend social events with a marked fear of possible threats. Because of these\\nfears, there is a significant impact on one’s social and occupational functioning.\\nIt is important to note that the cognitive interpretation of these social events is often excessive and out\\nof proportion to the actual risk of being negatively evaluated. As we saw in Mary’s case, when she\\nstumbled upon her words while reading to the class, none of her peers even noticed her mistake.\\nSituations in which individuals experience anxiety toward a real threat, such as bullying or ostracizing,\\nwould not be diagnosed with social anxiety disorder as the negative evaluation and threat are real.'),\n",

Panic Disorder\\nPanic disorder consists of a series of recurrent, unexpected panic attacks coupled with the fear of\\nfuture panic attacks. A panic attack is defined as a sudden or abrupt surge of fear or impending doom\\nalong with at least four physical or cognitive symptoms. Physical symptoms include heart palpitations,\\nsweating, trembling or shaking, shortness of breath, feeling as though they are being choked, chest\\npain, nausea, dizziness, chills or heat sensations, and numbness/tingling. Cognitive symptoms may\\nconsist of feelings of derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (feelings of being\\ndetached from oneself), the fear of losing control or ‘going crazy,’ or the fear of dying (APA, 2022).\\nWhile symptoms generally peak within a few minutes, it seems much longer for the individual\\nexperiencing the panic attack.\\nThere are two key components to panic disorder—the attacks are unexpected, meaning there is nothing\\nthat triggers them, and they are recurrent, meaning they occur multiple times. Because these panic\\nattacks occur frequently and are primarily “out of the blue,” they cause significant worry or anxiety in\\nthe individual as they are unsure of when the next attack will happen. In contrast to unexpected there\\nare also expected panic attacks, or those that have an obvious trigger. The DSM-5-TR states that\\npresence of expected panic attacks does not rule out the diagnosis of panic disorder as about half of\\nindividuals diagnosed with the disorder in the United States and Europe have both types of attacks\\n(APA, 2022).\\nIn some individuals, significant behavioral changes such as fear of leaving their home or attending large\\nevents occur as the individual is fearful an attack will happen in one of these situations, causing\\nembarrassment. Additionally, individuals report worry that others will think they are “going crazy” or\\nlosing control if they were to observe an individual experiencing a panic attack. Occasionally, an\\nadditional diagnosis of agoraphobia is given to an individual with panic disorder if their behaviors meet\\ndiagnostic criteria for this disorder as well.\\nThe frequency and intensity of these panic attacks vary widely among individuals. Some people report\\npanic attacks occurring once a week for months on end, others report more frequent attacks multiple\\ntimes a day, but then experience weeks or months without any attacks. The intensity of symptoms also\\nvaries among individuals, with some patients experiencing four or more symptoms (full-symptom) or\\nless than four (limited-symptom. Furthermore, individuals report variability within their panic attack\\nsymptoms, with some panic attacks presenting with more symptoms than others. To be diagnosed with\\npanic disorder, the individual must present with more than one unexpected full-symptom panic attack\\n(APA, 2022).\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nAll anxiety disorders share the hallmark symptoms of excessive fear or worry related to behavioral\\ndisturbances.\\nGeneralized anxiety disorder is characterized by an underlying excessive worry related to a wide'),\n",

For example, an individual with social anxiety disorder may\\nconsume more alcohol in social settings in efforts to alleviate the anxiety of the social situation.

Biological\\n     7.4.1.1. Biological – Genetic influences. While genetics have been known to contribute to the\\npresentation of anxiety symptoms, the interaction between genetics and stressful environmental\\ninfluences appears to account for more anxiety disorders than genetics alone (Bienvenu, Davydow, &\\nKendler, 2011). The quest to identify specific genes that may predispose individuals to develop anxiety\\ndisorders has led researchers to the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR). Mutation of the 5-HTTLPR\\ngene is related to a reduction in serotonin activity and an increase in anxiety-related personality traits\\n(Munafo, Brown, & Hairiri, 2008).\\n     7.4.1.2. Biological – Neurobiological structures. Researchers have identified several brain\\nstructures and pathways that are likely responsible for anxiety responses. Among those structures is the\\namygdala, the area of the brain that is responsible for storing memories related to emotional events\\n(Gorman, Kent, Sullivan, & Coplan, 2000). When presented with a fearful situation, the amygdala\\ninitiates a reaction to ready the body for a response. First, the amygdala triggers the hypothalamic-\\npituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis to prepare for immediate action— either to fight or flight. The second\\npathway is activated by the feared stimulus itself, by sending a sensory signal to the hippocampus and\\nprefrontal cortex, to determine if the threat is real or imagined. If it is determined that no threat is\\npresent, the amygdala sends a calming response to the HPA axis, thus reducing the level of fear. If a\\nthreat is present, the amygdala is activated, producing a fear response.\\nSpecific to panic disorder is the implication of the locus coeruleus, the brain structure that serves as\\nan “on-off” switch for norepinephrine neurotransmitters. It is believed that increased activation of the\\nlocus coeruleus results in panic-like symptoms; therefore, individuals with panic disorder may have a\\nhyperactive locus coeruleus, leaving them more susceptible to experience more intense and frequent'),\n",

This theory is\\nsupported by studies in which individuals experienced increased panic symptoms following the injection\\nof norepinephrine (Bourin, Malinge, & Guitton, 1995).\\nUnfortunately, norepinephrine and the locus coeruleus fail to fully explain the development of panic\\ndisorder, as treatment would be much easier if only norepinephrine was implicated. Therefore,\\nresearchers argue that a more complex neuropathway is likely responsible for the development of panic\\ndisorder. More specifically, the corticostriatal-thalamocortical (CSTC) circuit, also known as the\\nfear-specific circuit, is theorized as a major contributor to panic symptoms (Gutman, Gorman, & Hirsch,\\n2004). When an individual is presented with a frightening object or situation, the amygdala is activated,\\nsending a fear response to the anterior cingulate cortex and the orbitofrontal cortex. Additional\\nprojection from the amygdala to the hypothalamus activates endocrinologic responses to fear, releasing\\nadrenaline and cortisol to help prepare the body to fight or flight (Gutman, Gorman, & Hirsch, 2004).\\nThis complex pathway supports the theory that panic disorder is mediated by several neuroanatomical\\nstructures and their associated neurotransmitters.\\n \\n 7.4.2. Psychological\\n     7.4.2.1. Psychological – Cognitive. The cognitive perspective on the development of anxiety\\nrelated disorders centers around dysfunctional thought patterns. As seen in depression, maladaptive\\nassumptions are routinely observed in individuals with anxiety-related disorders, as they often engage\\nin interpreting events as dangerous or overreacting to potentially stressful events, which contributes to\\nan overall heightened anxiety level. These negative appraisals, in combination with a biological\\npredisposition to anxiety, likely contribute to the development of anxiety symptoms (Gallagher et al.,\\n2013).\\nSensitivity to physiological arousal not only contributes to anxiety disorders in general, but also for\\npanic disorder where individuals experience various physiological sensations and misinterpret them as\\ncatastrophic. One explanation for this theory is that individuals with panic disorder are more\\nsusceptible to more frequent and intensive physiological symptoms than the general public (Nillni,\\nRohan, & Zvolensky, 2012). Others argue that these individuals have had more trauma-related\\nexperiences in the past, and therefore, are quick to misevaluate their symptoms as a potential threat.\\nThis misevaluation of symptoms as impending disaster likely maintain symptoms as the cognitive\\nmisinterpretations to physiological arousal creates a negative feedback loop, leading to more\\nphysiological changes.\\nSocial anxiety is also primarily explained by cognitive theorists. Individuals with social anxiety disorder\\ntend to hold unattainable or extremely high social beliefs and expectations. Furthermore, they often\\nengage in preconceived maladaptive assumptions that they will behave incompetently in social\\nsituations and that their behaviors will lead to terrible consequences. Because of these beliefs, they\\nanticipate social disasters will occur and, therefore, avoid social encounters (or limit them to close\\nfriends/family members) in efforts to prevent the disaster (Moscovitch et al., 2013). Unfortunately,\\nthese cognitive appraisals are not only isolated to before and during the event. Individuals with social\\nanxiety disorder will also evaluate the social event after it has taken place, often obsessively reviewing\\nthe details. This overestimation of social performance negatively reinforces future avoidance of social\\nsituations.'),\n",

Psychological – Behavioral. The behavioral explanation for the development of anxiety\\ndisorders is mainly reserved for phobias—both specific and social phobia. More precisely, behavioral\\ntheorists focus on respondent conditioning – when two events that occur close together become\\nstrongly associated with one another, despite their lack of causal relationship (see Module 2 for an\\nexplanation of respondent conditioning). Watson and Rayner’s (1920) infamous Little Albert experiment\\nis an example of how respondent conditioning can be used to induce fear through associations. In this\\nstudy, Little Albert developed a fear of white rats by pairing a white rat with a loud sound. This\\nexperiment, although lacking ethical standards, was groundbreaking in the development of learned\\nbehaviors. Over time, researchers have been able to replicate these findings (in more ethically sound\\nways) to provide further evidence of the role of respondent conditioning in the development of phobias.\\n     7.4.2.3. Psychological – Modeling is another behavioral explanation of the development of\\nspecific and social phobias. In modeling, an individual acquires a fear though observation and imitation\\n(Bandura & Rosenthal, 1966). For example, when a young child observes their parent display irrational\\nfear of an animal, the child may then begin to display similar behavior. Similarly, seeing another\\nindividual being ridiculed in a social setting may increase the chances of developing social anxiety, as\\nthe individual may become fearful that they would experience a similar situation in the future. It is\\nspeculated that the maintenance of these phobias is due to the avoidance of the feared item or social\\nsetting, thus preventing the individual from learning that the object or situation is not something that\\nshould be feared.\\nWhile modeling and respondent conditioning largely explain the development of phobias, there is some\\nspeculation that the accumulation of many these learned fears will develop into generalized anxiety\\ndisorder. Through stimulus generalization, or the tendency for the conditioned stimulus to evoke\\nsimilar responses to other stimuli, a fear of one stimulus (such as the dog) may become generalized to\\nother items (such as all animals). As these fears begin to grow, a more generalized anxiety will present,\\nas opposed to a specific phobia.\\n \\n7.4.3. Sociocultural\\nSeeing how prominent the biological and psychological constructs are in explaining the development of\\nanxiety-related disorders, we also need to review the social constructs that contribute and maintain\\nanxiety disorders. While characteristics such as living in poverty, experiencing significant daily\\nstressors, and increased exposure to traumatic events are all identified as significant contributors to\\nanxiety disorders, additional sociocultural influences such as gender and discrimination have also\\nreceived considerable attention, mainly due to the epidemiological nature of the disorder.\\nGender has largely been researched within anxiety disorders due to the consistent discrepancy in the\\ndiagnosis rate between men and women. As previously discussed, women are routinely diagnosed with\\nanxiety disorders more often than men, a trend that is observed throughout the entire lifespan. One\\npotential explanation for this discrepancy is the influence of social pressures on women. Women are\\nmore susceptible to experience traumatic experiences throughout their life, which may contribute to\\nanxious appraisals of future events. Furthermore, women are more likely to use emotion-focused\\ncoping, which is less effective in reducing distress than problem-focused coping (McLean &\\nAnderson, 2009). These factors may increase levels of stress hormones within women that leave them\\nsusceptible to develop symptoms of anxiety. Therefore, it appears a combination of genetic,'),\n",

Generalized Anxiety Disorder\\n     7.5.1.1. Psychopharmacology. Benzodiazepines, a class of sedative-hypnotic drugs that will be\\ndiscussed in more detail in the substance abuse module, originally replaced barbiturates as the leading\\nanti-anxiety medication due to their less addictive nature, yet equally effective ability to calm\\nindividuals at low dosages. Unfortunately, as more research was done on benzodiazepines, serious side\\neffects, as well as physical dependence of benzodiazepines at large dosages, has routinely been\\ndocumented (NIMH, 2013). Due to these negative effects, selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors\\n(SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are generally considered to be first-\\nline medication options for those with generalized anxiety disorder. Findings indicate a 30-50% positive\\nresponse rate to these psychopharmacological interventions (Reinhold & Rickels, 2015). Unfortunately,\\nnone of these medications continue to provide any benefit once they are stopped; therefore, other\\neffective treatment options such as CBT, relaxation training, and biofeedback are often encouraged\\nbefore the use of pharmacological interventions.\\n     7.5.1.2. Rational-Emotive therapy. Albert Ellis developed rational emotive therapy in the\\nmid-1950s as one of the first forms of cognitive-behavioral therapy. Ellis proposed that individuals were\\nnot aware of the effect their negative thoughts had on their behaviors and various relationships, and\\nthus, established a treatment to address these thoughts and provide relief to those suffering from\\nanxiety and depression. The goal of rational emotive therapy is to identify irrational, self-defeating\\nassumptions, challenge the rationality of those assumptions, and to replace them with new, more\\nproductive thoughts and feelings. By identifying and replacing these assumptions, the individual will\\nexperience relief of generalized anxiety disorder symptoms (Ellis, 2014).\\n     7.5.1.3. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). CBT is discussed in detail in the Mood Disorder\\nModule; however, it is also among the most effective treatment options for a variety of anxiety\\ndisorders, including generalized anxiety disorder. Findings suggest 60 percent of individuals report a\\nsignificant reduction/elimination in anxious thoughts one-year post treatment (Hanrahan, Field, Jones,\\n& Davy, 2013). The fundamental goal of CBT is a combination of cognitive and behavioral strategies\\naimed to identify and restructure maladaptive thoughts while also providing opportunities to utilize\\nthese more effective thought patterns through exposure-based experiences. Through repetition, the\\nindividual will be able to identify and replace anxious thoughts outside of therapy sessions, ultimately\\nreducing their overall anxiety levels (Borkovec, & Ruscio, 2001).\\n     7.5.1.4. Biofeedback. Biofeedback provides a visual representation of a patient’s physiological\\narousal. To achieve this feedback, a patient is connected to a computer that provides continuous\\ninformation on their physiological states. There are several ways a patient can connect to the computer.\\nAmong the most common is electromyography (EMG). EMG measures the amount of muscle activity\\ncurrently experienced by the individual. An electrode is placed on a patient’s skin just above a major\\nmuscle group, usually the forearm or the forehead. Other common areas of measurement are'),\n",

The theory behind biofeedback is that in providing a patient with a visual\\nrepresentation of changes in their physiological state, they become more skilled at voluntarily reducing\\ntheir physiological arousal, and thus, their overall sense of anxiety or stress. While research has\\nidentified only a modest effect of biofeedback on anxiety levels, patients do report a positive experience\\nwith the treatment due to the visual feedback of their physiological arousal (Brambrink, 2004).\\n \\n7.5.2. Specific Phobias\\n     7.5.2.1. Exposure treatments. While there are many treatment options for specific phobias,\\nresearch routinely supports the behavioral techniques as the most effective treatment strategies.\\nSeeing as the behavioral theory suggests phobias develop via respondent conditioning, the treatment\\napproach revolves around breaking the maladaptive association between the object and fear. This is\\ngenerally accomplished through exposure treatments. As the name implies, the individual is exposed\\nto their feared stimuli. This can be done in several different approaches: systematic desensitization,\\nflooding, and modeling.\\nSystematic desensitization is an exposure technique that utilizes relaxation strategies to help calm\\nthe individual as they are presented with the fearful object. The notion behind this technique is that\\nboth fear and relaxation cannot exist at the same time; therefore, the individual learns how to replace\\ntheir fearful reaction with a calm, relaxing reaction.\\nTo begin, the patient, with assistance from the clinician, will identify a fear hierarchy, or a list of feared\\nobjects/situations ordered from least fearful to most fearful. After teaching several different types of\\nrelaxation techniques, the clinician will present items from the fear hierarchy, starting from the least\\nfearful object/subject, while the patient practices using the learned relaxation techniques. The\\npresentation of the feared object/situation can be in person—in vivo exposure—or it can be\\nimagined—imaginal exposure. Imaginal exposure tends to be less intensive than in vivo exposure;\\nhowever, it is less effective than in vivo exposure in eliminating the phobia. Depending on the phobia, in\\nvivo exposure may not be an option, such as with a fear of a tornado. Once the patient can effectively\\nemploy relaxation techniques to reduce their anxiety to a manageable level, the clinician will slowly\\nmove up the fear hierarchy until the individual does not experience excessive fear of all objects on the\\nlist.\\n Flooding is another exposure technique in which the clinician does not utilize a fear hierarchy, but\\nrather repeatedly exposes the individual to their most feared object or situation. Similar to systematic\\ndesensitization, flooding can be done in either in vivo or imaginal exposure. Clearly, this technique is\\nmore intensive than systematic or gradual exposure to feared objects. Because of this, patients are at a\\ngreater likelihood of dropping out of treatment, thus not successfully overcoming their phobias.\\n Modeling is another common technique used to treat phobias (Kelly, Barker, Field, Wilson, &\\nReynolds, 2010). In this technique, the clinician approaches the feared object/subject while the patient'),\n",

As the name implies, the clinician models appropriate behaviors when exposed to the feared\\nstimulus, showing that the phobia is irrational. After modeling several times, the clinician encourages\\nthe patient to confront the feared stimulus with the clinician, and then ultimately, without the clinician.\\n \\n7.5.3. Agoraphobia\\nSimilar to the treatment approaches for specific phobias, exposure-based techniques are among the\\nmost effective treatment options for individuals with agoraphobia. However, unlike the high success\\nrate in specific phobias, exposure treatment for agoraphobia has been less effective in providing\\ncomplete relief from the disorder. The success rate may be impacted by the high comorbidity rate of\\nagoraphobia and panic disorder. Because of the additional presentation of panic symptoms, exposure\\ntreatments alone are not the most effective in eliminating symptoms as residual panic symptoms often\\nremain (Craske & Barlow, 2014). Therefore, the best treatment approach for those with agoraphobia\\nand panic disorder is a combination of exposure and CBT techniques (see panic disorder  treatment).\\nFor individuals with agoraphobia without panic symptoms, the use of group therapy in combination with\\nindividual exposure therapy has been identified as a successful treatment option. The group therapy\\nformat allows the individual to engage in exposure-based field trips to various community locations,\\nwhile also maintaining a sense of support and security from a group of individuals whom they know.\\nResearch indicates that this type of treatment provides improvement for nearly 60 to 80 percent of\\npatients with agoraphobia; however, there is a relatively high rate of partial relapse, suggesting that\\nlong-term treatment or booster sessions should continue for several years at minimum (Craske &\\nBarlow, 2014).\\n \\n7.5.4. Social Anxiety Disorder\\n     7.5.4.1. Exposure. A hallmark treatment approach for all anxiety disorders is exposure. Specific to\\nsocial anxiety disorder, the individual is encouraged to engage in social situations where they are likely\\nto experience increased anxiety. Initially, the clinician will role-play various social situations with the\\npatient so they can practice social interactions in a safe, controlled environment (Rodebaugh, Holaway,\\n& Heimberg, 2004). As the patient becomes habituated to the interaction with the clinician, the\\nclinician and patient may venture outside of the treatment room and engage in social situations with\\nrandom strangers at various locations such as fast-food restaurants, local stores, libraries, etc. The\\npatient is encouraged to continue with these exposures outside of treatment to help reduce anxiety\\nrelated to social situations.\\n     7.5.4.2. Social skills training. This treatment is specific to social anxiety disorder as it focuses on\\nthe patient’s skill deficits or inadequate social interactions that contribute to their negative social\\nexperiences and anxiety. During a session, the clinician may use a combination of skills such as\\nmodeling, corrective feedback, and positive reinforcement to provide feedback and encouragement to\\nthe patient regarding their behavioral interactions (Rodebaugh, Holaway, & Heimberg, 2004). By\\nincorporating the clinician’s feedback into their social repertoire, the patient can engage in positive\\nsocial behaviors outside of the treatment room and improve their overall social interactions while\\nreducing ongoing social anxiety.'),\n",

Cognitive restructuring. While exposure and social skills training are suitable treatment\\noptions, research routinely supports the need to incorporate cognitive restructuring as an additive\\ncomponent in treatment to provide substantial symptom reduction. Like cognitive restructuring\\npreviously discussed in the Mood Disorder module, the clinician will work with the therapist to identify\\nnegative, automatic thoughts that contribute to the distress in social situations. The clinician can then\\nhelp the patient establish new, positive thoughts to replace these negative thoughts. Research indicates\\nthat implementing cognitive restructuring techniques before, during, and after exposure sessions\\nenhances the overall effects of treatment of social anxiety disorder (Heimberg & Becker, 2002).\\n \\n7.5.5. Panic Disorder\\n     7.5.5.1. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). CBT is the most effective treatment option for\\nindividuals with panic disorder as the focus is on correcting misinterpretations of bodily sensations\\n(Craske & Barlow, 2014). Nearly 80 percent of people with panic disorder report complete remission of\\nsymptoms after mastering the following five components of CBT for panic disorder (Craske & Barlow,\\n2014).\\nPsychoeducation. Treatment begins by educating the patient on the nature of panic disorder, the\\nunderlying causes of panic disorder, as well as the mechanisms that maintain the disorder such as the\\nphysical, cognitive, and behavioral response systems (Craske & Barlow, 2014). This part of treatment is\\nfundamental in correcting any myths or misconceptions about panic symptoms, as they often contribute\\nto the exacerbation of panic symptoms.\\nSelf-monitoring. Self-monitoring, or the act of self-observation, is essential to the CBT treatment\\nprocess for panic disorder. In this part of treatment, the individual is taught to identify the physiological\\ncues immediately leading up to and during a panic attack.  Then, the patient is encouraged to recognize\\nand document the thoughts and behaviors associated with these physiological symptoms. By bringing\\nawareness to the symptoms, as well as the relationship between physical arousal and cognitive-\\nbehavioral responses, the patient learns the fundamental processes with which they can manage their\\npanic symptoms (Craske & Barlow, 2014).\\nRelaxation training. Similar to that in exposure-based treatment for phobias, prior to engaging in\\nexposure training, the individual must learn relaxation techniques to apply during onset of panic\\nattacks. Though breathing training was once included as the relaxation training technique of choice for\\npanic disorder more recent research has failed to support this technique as effective in the use of panic\\ndisorder due to the high incidence of hyperventilation during panic attacks (Schmidt et al., 2000).\\nFindings suggest that breathing retraining is more commonly misused as a safety behavior or means for\\navoiding physical symptoms as opposed to an effective physiological response to stress (Craske &\\nBarlow, 2014).\\nProgressive muscle relaxation. To replace the breathing retraining, Craske & Barlow (2014) suggest\\nprogressive muscle relaxation (PMR). In PMR, the patient learns to tense and relax various large\\nmuscle groups throughout the body. The patient is encouraged to start at either the head or the feet,\\nand gradually work their way through the entire body, holding the tension for roughly 10 seconds\\nbefore relaxing. The theory behind PMR is that in tensing the muscles for a prolonged period, the\\nindividual exhausts those muscles, forcing them (and eventually) the entire body to engage in relaxation\\n(McCallie, Blum, & Hood, 2006).'),\n",

Cognitive restructuring, or the ability to recognize cognitive errors and\\nreplace them with alternate, more appropriate thoughts, is likely the most powerful part of CBT\\ntreatment for panic disorder, aside from the exposure part. As noted previously, cognitive restructuring\\ninvolves identifying the role of thoughts in generating and maintaining emotions. The clinician\\nencourages the patient to view these thoughts as “hypotheses” as opposed to fact, which allows the\\nbeliefs to be questioned and challenged. This is where the detailed recordings produced by self-\\nmonitoring are helpful. By discussing what the patient has recorded for the relationship between\\nphysiological arousal and thoughts/behaviors, the clinician can help the patient restructure the\\nmaladaptive thought processes to more positive thought processes, which in return, helps to reduce\\nfear and anxiety.\\nExposure. As discussed in detail in the specific phobia section, the patient is next encouraged to\\nengage in a variety of exposure techniques such as in vivo exposure and interoceptive exposure, while\\nalso incorporating the cognitive restructuring and relaxation techniques previously learned to reduce\\nand eliminate ongoing distress.  Interoceptive exposure involves inducing panic-specific symptoms to\\nthe individual repeatedly for a prolonged period, so that maladaptive thoughts about the sensations can\\nbe disconfirmed and conditional anxiety responses are extinguished (Craske & Barlow, 2014). Some\\nexamples of these exposure techniques include spinning a patient repeatedly in a chair to induce\\ndizziness and breathing in a paper bag to cause hyperventilation. These treatment approaches can be\\npresented gradually; however, the patient must endure the physiological sensations for at least 30\\nseconds to 1 minute to ensure adequate time for applying cognitive strategies to misappraisal of\\ncognitive symptoms (Craske & Barlow, 2014).\\nInteroceptive exposure is continued both in and outside of treatment until panic symptoms remit. Over\\ntime, the habituation of fear within an exposure session ultimately leads to habituation across treatment\\nand long-term remission of panic symptoms (Foa & McNally, 1996).  Occasionally, panic symptoms will\\nreturn in individuals who report complete remission of panic disorder. Follow-up booster sessions\\nreviewing the steps above are generally effective in eliminating symptoms again.\\n     7.5.5.2. Pharmacological interventions. According to Craske & Barlow (2014), nearly half of\\npatients with panic disorder present to psychotherapy already on medication, likely prescribed by their\\nprimary care physician. Some researchers argue that anti-anxiety medications impede the progress of\\nCBT treatment as the individual is not able to fully experience the physiological sensations during\\nexposure sessions, thus limiting their ability to modify maladaptive thoughts and maintaining the panic\\nsymptoms. Results from large clinical trials suggest no advantage during or immediately after treatment\\nof combining CBT and medication (Craske & Barlow, 2014). Additionally, when the medication was\\ndiscontinued post-treatment, the CBT+ medication groups fared worse than the CBT treatment-only\\ngroups, thus supporting the theory that immersion in interoceptive exposure is limited due to the use of\\nmedication. Therefore, it is suggested that medications be reserved for those who do not respond to\\nCBT therapy alone (Kampman, Keijers, Hoogduin & Hendriks, 2002).\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nTreatment options for generalized anxiety disorder include benzodiazepines, rational-emotive'),\n",

Furthermore, the somatic symptoms could take on many forms. For example, the individual\\nmay be faking the physical symptoms, imagining the symptoms, exaggerating the symptoms, or they\\ncould be real and triggered by external factors such as stress or other psychological disorders. The\\nsymptoms also may be part of a real medical illness or disorder, and therefore, the symptoms should be\\ntreated medicinally.\\nAll the disorders within this chapter share a common feature: there is a presence of somatic symptoms\\nand/or illness anxiety associated with significant distress or impairment. Oftentimes, individuals with a\\nsomatic disorder will present to their primary care physician with their physical complaints.\\nOccasionally, they will be referred to clinical psychologists after an extensive medical evaluation\\nconcludes that a medical diagnosis cannot explain their current symptoms. As you will see, despite their\\nsimilarities, there are key features that distinguish the disorders in this class from one another.\\n \\n8.1.1. Somatic Symptom Disorder\\nIndividuals with somatic symptom disorder often present with multiple somatic symptoms at one\\ntime. These symptoms are significant enough to impact their daily functioning, such as preventing them\\nfrom attending school, work, or family obligations. The symptoms can be localized (i.e., in one spot) or\\ndiffused (i.e., entire body), and can be specific or nonspecific (e.g., fatigue). Individuals with somatic\\nsymptom disorder often report excessive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors surrounding their somatic\\nsymptoms (APA, 2022). For example, individuals with somatic symptom disorder may spend an\\nexcessive amount of time or energy evaluating their symptoms, as well as the potential seriousness of\\ntheir symptoms. A lack of medical explanation is not needed for a diagnosis of somatic symptom\\ndisorder, as it is assumed that the individual’s suffering is authentic. Somatic symptom disorder is often\\ndiagnosed when another medical condition is present, as these two diagnoses are not mutually\\nexclusive.\\nSomatic symptom disorder patients generally present with significant worry about their illness. Their\\ninterpretation of symptoms is often viewed as threatening, harmful, or troublesome (APA, 2022).\\nBecause of their negative appraisals, they fear that their medical status is more serious than it typically\\nis, and high levels of distress are often reported. Oftentimes these patients will “shop” at different\\nphysician offices to confirm the seriousness of their symptoms.\\n \\n8.1.2. Illness Anxiety Disorder'),\n",

The key distinction between illness anxiety disorder\\nand somatic symptom disorder is that an individual with illness anxiety disorder does not typically\\npresent with any somatic symptoms. Occasionally an individual will present with a somatic symptom;\\nhowever, the intensity of the symptom is mild and does not drive the anxiety. Acquiring a serious illness\\ndrives concerns and they will even avoid visiting a sick relative or friend for fear of jeopardizing their\\nown health.\\nIndividuals with illness anxiety disorder generally are cleared medically; however, some individuals are\\ndiagnosed with a medical illness. In this case, their anxiety surrounding the severity of their disorder is\\nexcessive or disproportionate to their actual medical diagnosis. While an individual’s concern for an\\nillness may be due to a physical sign or sensation, most individual’s concerns are derived not from a\\nphysical complaint, but their actual anxiety related to a suspected medical disorder. This excessive\\nworry often expands to general anxiety regarding one’s health and disease. Unfortunately, this anxiety\\ndoes not decrease even after reassurance from a medical provider or negative test results, even when\\nprovided by multiple physicians and diagnostic tests.\\nAs one can imagine, the preoccupation and anxiety associated with attaining a medical illness severely\\nimpacts daily functioning. The individual will often spend copious amounts of time scanning and\\nanalyzing their body for “clues” of potential ailments. Additionally, an excessive amount of time is often\\nspent on internet searches related to symptoms and rare illnesses. Illness becomes a central feature of\\nthe person’s identity and self-image. Although extreme, some cases of invalidism have been reported\\ndue to illness anxiety disorder (APA, 2022).\\n \\nMaking Sense of the Disorders\\nIn relation to somatic symptom and related disorders, note the following:\\nFor somatic symptom disorder …… the patient presents with multiple somatic symptoms at one\\ntime that are significant enough to impact their daily functioning\\nFor illness anxiety disorder … the patient does not typically present with any somatic symptoms\\nbut if they do, the symptoms are just mild in intensity\\n \\n8.1.3. Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder (Conversion Disorder)\\nFunctional neurological symptom (conversion) disorder occurs when an individual presents with\\none or more symptoms of altered voluntary motor or sensory function (APA, 2022). Common motor\\nsymptoms include weakness or paralysis, abnormal movements (e.g., tremors), and gait abnormalities\\n(i.e., limping). Sensory symptoms include altered, reduced, or absent skin sensation, vision, or hearing.\\nLess commonly seen are epileptic seizures and episodes of unresponsiveness resembling fainting or\\ncoma (Marshall et al., 2013). The disorder was called “conversion disorder” in prior versions of the\\nDSM and in the psychiatric literature. As noted, “The term “conversion” originated in psychoanalytic\\ntheory, which proposes that unconscious psychic conflict is “converted” into physical symptoms” (APA,'),\n",

While a diagnosis of conversion disorder requires that the symptoms not be\\nexplained by a neurological disease, just because a medical provider fails to provide evidence that it is\\nnot a specific medical disorder is not sufficient. Therefore, there must be evidence of an incompatibility\\nof the medical disorder and the symptoms. For example, an individual experiencing a seizure would\\nrequire a normal simultaneous electroencephalogram (EEG), indicating that there is not epileptic\\nactivity during what was previously thought of as an epileptic seizure.\\n \\n8.1.4. Factitious Disorder\\nFactitious disorder differs from the three previously discussed somatic disorders in that there is\\ndeliberate falsification of medical or psychological symptoms imposed on oneself or on another, with the\\noverall intention of deception. While a medical condition may be present, the severity of impairment\\nrelated to the medical condition is more excessive due to the individual’s need to deceive those around\\nthem. Even more alarming is that this disorder is not only observed in the individual leading the\\ndeception— it can also be present in another individual, often a child or an individual with a\\ncompromised mental status who is not aware of the deception behind their illness.\\nSome examples of factitious disorder behaviors include, but are not limited to, altering a urine or blood\\ntest, falsifying medical records, ingesting a substance that would indicate abnormal laboratory results,\\nphysically injuring oneself, and inducing illness by injecting or ingesting a harmful substance. Although\\nmost individuals with factitious disorder seek treatment from health care professionals, some choose to\\nmislead community members either in person or online about the illness or injury (APA, 2022). While it\\nis unclear why an individual would want to fake their own (or someone else’s) physical illness, there is\\nsome evidence suggesting that factors such as depression, lack of parental support during childhood, or\\nan excessive need for social support may contribute to this disorder (McDermott, Leamon, Feldman, &\\nScott, 2012; Ozden & Canat, 1999; Feldman & Feldman, 1995).\\nIndividuals with factitious disorder are at risk for experiencing psychological distress or functional\\nimpairment causing harm to themselves and others such as family, friends, heath care professionals,\\nand faith leaders. The DSM-5-TR states, “Whereas some aspects of factitious disorders might represent\\ncriminal behavior, such criminal behavior and mental illness are not mutually exclusive” (APA, 2022, pg.\\n368).\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nSomatic symptom disorder is characterized by the presence of multiple somatic symptoms,\\nwhether localized or diffused and specific or nonspecific, at one time which impact daily\\nfunctioning.\\nIllness anxiety disorder is characterized by concern over having or acquiring a serious illness, and'),\n",

More specifically, anxiety and\\ndepressive disorders are among the most commonly co-diagnosed disorders for somatic disorders.\\nWhile there is not a lot of information regarding specific comorbidities among somatic symptom and\\nrelated disorders, there is some evidence to suggest that those with illness anxiety disorder are at risk\\nof developing OCD and personality disorders. Similarly, personality disorders are more common in\\nindividuals with functional neurological symptom disorder than the general public. Somatic symptom\\ndisorder is also comorbid with PTSD and OCD.  (APA, 2022).

Two factors initiate and maintain somatic symptoms: primary gain and secondary\\ngain. Primary gains produce internal motivators, whereas secondary gains produce external motivators\\n(Jones, Carmel & Ball, 2008). When you relate this to somatic disorders, the primary gain, according to\\npsychodynamic theorists, provides protection from the anxiety or emotional symptoms and/or conflicts.\\nThis need for protection is expressed via a physical symptom such as pain, headache, etc. The\\nsecondary gain, the external experiences from the physical symptoms that maintain these physical'),\n",

Cognitive\\nCognitive theorists often believe that somatic disorders are a result of negative beliefs or exaggerated\\nfears of physiological sensations. Individuals with somatic related disorders may have a heightened\\nsensitivity to bodily sensations. This sensitivity, combined with their maladaptive thought patterns, may\\nlead individuals to overanalyze and interpret their physiological symptoms in a negative light.\\nFor example, an individual with a headache may catastrophize the symptoms and believe that their\\nheadache is the direct result of a brain tumor, as opposed to stress or other inoculate reasons. When\\ntheir medical provider does not confirm this diagnosis, the individual may then catastrophize even\\nfurther, believing they have an extremely rare disorder that requires an evaluation from a specialist.\\n \\n8.4.3. Behavioral\\nKeeping true with the behavioral approach to psychological disorders, behaviorists propose that\\nsomatic disorders are developed and maintained by reinforcers. More specifically, individuals\\nexperiencing significant somatic symptoms are often rewarded by gaining attention from other people\\n(Witthoft & Hiller, 2010). These rewards may also extend to more significant factors, such as receiving\\ndisability payments.\\nWhile the behavioral theory of somatic disorders appears to be like the psychodynamic theory of\\nsecondary gains, there is a clear distinction between the two – behaviorists view these gains as the\\nprimary reason for the development and maintenance of the disorder, whereas psychodynamic theorists\\nview these gains as secondary, only after the underlying conflicts create the disorder.\\n \\n8.4.4. Sociocultural\\nThere are a couple of different ways that sociocultural factors contribute to somatic related disorders.\\nFirst, there is the social factor of familial influence that likely plays a significant role in the attention to\\nsomatic symptoms. Individuals with somatic symptom disorder are more likely to have a family member\\nor close friend who is overly attentive to their somatic symptoms or report high anxiety related to their\\nhealth (Watt, O’Connor, Stewart, Moon, & Terry, 2008; Schulte, Petermann, & Noeker, 2010).\\nCulturally, Western countries express less of a focus on somatic complaints compared to those in the\\nEastern part of the world. This may be explained by the different evaluations of the relationship\\nbetween mind and body. For example, Westerners tend to have a view that psychological symptoms\\nsometimes influence somatic symptoms, whereas Easterners focus more heavily on the mind-body\\nrelationship and how psychological and somatic symptoms interact with one another.  These different\\ncultural beliefs are routinely seen in research where Asian populations are more likely to report the\\nphysical symptoms related to stress than the cognitive or emotional problems that many in the United'),\n",

Once an individual does not find relief from their symptoms after meeting with several\\ndifferent physicians, they often do willingly engage in psychotherapy, psychopharmacology, or both (Raj\\net al., 2014).\\nAmong the most effective treatment approaches is the biopsychosocial model of treatment. This\\napproach considers the various biological, psychological, and social factors that influence the illness\\nand presenting symptoms (Gatchel et al., 2007).

The interdisciplinary approach involves a higher level of care\\nas the multiple disciplines interact with one another and identify a treatment goal (Gatchel et al., 2007).\\nThis approach, although more difficult to find, particularly in more rural settings, is presumed to be\\nmore effective due to the integration of health care providers and their ability to work together to treat\\nthe patient uniformly.\\n \\n8.5.1. Psychotherapy\\n      8.5.1.1. Psychodynamic. Interpersonal psychotherapy, a type of psychodynamic therapy, has been\\nfound to be efficacious in treating somatic disorders. Interpersonal psychotherapy focuses on the\\nrelationship between self-experience and the unconscious, and how these factors contribute to body\\ndysfunction. This type of treatment has been shown to reduce anxiety, depression, and improve the\\noverall quality of life immediately following treatment; however, effects appear to diminish over time\\n(Abass et al., 2014; Steinert et al., 2015).\\n      8.5.1.2. CBT. Traditional cognitive-behavioral therapies (CBT) have been employed to address the\\ncognitive attributions and maladaptive coping strategies that are responsible for the development and\\nmaintenance of the disorder. The most common misattribution for these disorders is catastrophic\\nthinking, or the rumination about worst-case scenario outcomes. Additionally, goals of CBT treatment\\nare the acceptance of the medical condition, addressing avoidance behaviors, and mediating\\nexpectations of treatment (Gatchel et al., 2014).\\n      8.5.1.3. Behavioral. Behavioral therapies have also been shown to effectively manage complex\\nchronic somatic symptoms, particularly pain. The behavioral approach involves bringing attention to\\nphysiological symptoms, the individual’s attribution to those symptoms, and the subsequent anxiety\\nproduced by the negative attributions (Looper & Kirmayer, 2002).\\n \\n8.5.2. Psychopharmacology\\nPsychopharmacological interventions are rarely used due to possible side effects and unknown efficacy.\\nGiven that these individuals already have a heightened reaction to their physiological symptoms, there\\nis a high likelihood that the side effects of medication would produce more harm than help. With that\\nsaid, psychopharmacological interventions may be helpful for those individuals who have comorbid\\npsychological disorders such as depression or anxiety, which may negatively impact their ability to\\nengage in psychotherapy (McGeary, Harzell, McGeary, & Gatchel, 2016).\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nThe biopsychosocial model of treatment is one of the most effective for somatic disorders as it\\nconsiders the various biological, psychological, and social factors that influence the illness and'),\n",

Psychological or behavioral factors adversely affect the medical condition by, “…influencing\\nits course or treatment, by constituting an additional well-established health risk factor, or by\\ninfluencing the underlying pathophysiology to precipitate or exacerbate symptoms or to necessitate\\nmedical attention” (APA, 2022, pg. 365). It is believed that a lack of positive coping strategies,\\npsychological distress, or maladaptive health behaviors exacerbate these physical symptoms (McGeary,\\nHarzell, McGeary, & Gatchel, 2016).\\n \\n8.6.1.

We will briefly review these disorders and discuss the associated\\npsychological features believed to exacerbate symptoms.\\n      8.6.1.1. Headaches. Among the most common types of headaches are migraines and tension\\nheadaches (Williamson, 1981). Migraine headaches are often more severe and are explained by a\\nthrobbing pain localized to one side of the head, frequently accompanied by nausea, vomiting,\\nsensitivity to light, and vertigo. It is believed that migraines are caused by the blood vessels in the brain\\nnarrowing, thus reducing the blood flow to various parts of the brain, followed by the same vessels later\\nexpanding, thus rapidly changing the blood flow. It is estimated that 23 million people in the U.S. alone\\nsuffer from migraines (Williamson, Barker, Veron-Guidry, 1994).\\nTension headaches are often described as a dull, constant ache localized to one part of the head or\\nneck; however, it can co-occur in multiple places at one time. Unlike migraines, nausea, vomiting, and\\nsensitivity to light do not often occur with tension headaches. Tension headaches, as well as migraines,\\nare believed to be primarily caused by stress as they are in response to sustained muscle contraction\\nthat is often exhibited by those under extreme stress or emotion (Williamson, Barker, Veron-Guidry,\\n1994).  In efforts to reduce the frequency and intensity of both migraines and tension headaches,\\nindividuals have found relief in relaxation techniques, as well as the use of biofeedback training to help\\nencourage the relaxation of muscles.\\n      8.6.1.2. Gastrointestinal. Among the two most common types of gastrointestinal\\npsychophysiological disorders are ulcers and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Ulcers, or painful\\nsores in the stomach lining, occur when mucus from digestive juices are reduced, allowing digestive\\nacids to burn a hole into the stomach lining. Among the most common type of ulcers are peptic ulcers,\\nwhich are caused by the bacteria H. pylori (Sung, Kuipers, El-Serag, 2009). While there is evidence to\\nsupport the involvement of stress in the development of dyspeptic symptoms, the evidence linking\\nstress and peptic ulcers is slowly growing. (Purdy, 2013). Researchers believe that while H. pylori must\\nbe present for a peptic ulcer to develop, increased stress levels may impact the amount of digestive acid\\npresent in the stomach lining, thus increasing the frequency and intensity of symptoms (Sung, Kuipers,\\nEl-Serag, 2009).\\nIBS is a chronic, functional disorder of the gastrointestinal tract. Common symptoms of IBS include\\nabdominal pain and extreme bowel habits (diarrhea or constipation). It affects up to a quarter of the\\npopulation and is responsible for nearly half of all referrals to gastroenterologists (Sandler, 1990).\\nBecause IBS is a functional disorder, there are no known structural, chemical, or physiological\\nabnormalities responsible for the symptoms. However, there is conclusive evidence that IBS symptoms\\nare related to psychological distress, particularly in those with anxiety or depression. Although more\\nresearch is needed to pinpoint the timing between the onset of IBS and psychological disorders,\\npreliminary evidence suggests that psychological distress is present before IBS symptoms. Therefore,\\nIBS may be best explained as a somatic expression of associated psychological problems (Sykes,\\nBlanchard, Lackner, Keefer, & Krasner, 2003).\\n      8.6.1.3. Insomnia. Insomnia, the difficulty falling or staying asleep, occurs in more than one-third\\nof the U.S. population, with approximately 10% of patients reporting chronic insomnia (Perlis &\\nGehrman, 2013). While exact pathways of chronic psychophysiological insomnia are unclear, there is\\nevidence of some biopsychosocial factors that may predispose an individual to develop insomnia such as'),\n",

Part of the difficulty with\\ninsomnia is the fact that these psychological symptoms can impact one’s ability to fall asleep; however,\\nwe also know that lack of adequate sleep also predisposes individuals to increased psychological\\ndistress. Due to this cyclic nature of psychological distress and insomnia, intervention for both sleep\\nissues as well as psychological issues is vital to managing symptoms.\\n      8.6.1.4. Cardiovascular. Heart disease has been the leading cause of death in the United States\\nfor the past several decades. Costs related to disability, medical procedures, and societal burdens are\\nestimated to be $444 billion a year (Purdy, 2013). With this large financial burden, there have been\\nconsiderable efforts to identify risk and protective factors in predicting cardiovascular mortality.\\nResearchers have identified that depression is a predictor of early-onset coronary heart disease\\n(Ketterer, Knysk, Khanal, & Hudson, 2006). More specifically, there is a five-fold increase of depression\\nin those with coronary heart disease than the general population (Ketterer, Knysk, Khanal, & Hudson,\\n2006). Additionally, anxiety and anger have also been identified as an early predictor of cardiac events,\\nsuggesting psychological interventions aimed at reducing anxiety and establishing positive coping\\nstrategies for anger management may be effective in reducing future cardiac events (Ketterer, Knysk,\\nKhanal, & Hudson, 2006).\\n      8.6.1.5. Hypertension. Also called or chronically elevated blood pressure, is also found to be\\naffected by psychological factors. More specifically, constant stress, anxiety, and depression have all\\nbeen found to impact the likelihood of a cardiac event due to their impact on vasoconstriction (Purdy,\\n2013). Elevated inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein, which is indicative of plaque\\ninstability, has been found in chronically depressed individuals, thus predisposing them to potential\\nheart attacks (Ketterer, Knysk, Khanal, & Hudson, 2006).\\n \\n8.6.2. Treatments for Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions\\nAs more information regarding contributing factors to psychophysiological disorders is discovered,\\nmore psychological treatment approaches have been developed and applied to these medical problems.\\nThe most common types of treatments include relaxation training, biofeedback, hypnosis, traditional\\nCBT treatments, group therapy, as well as a combination of the previous treatments.\\n      8.6.2.1. Relaxation training. Relaxation training essentially teaches individuals how to relax their\\nmuscles on command. While relaxation is used in combination with other psychological interventions to\\nreduce anxiety (as seen in PTSD and various anxiety disorders), it has also been shown to be effective in\\ntreating physical symptoms such as headaches, chronic pain, as well as pain related to specific causes\\n(e.g., injection sites, side effects of medications; McKenna et al., 2015).\\n      8.6.2.2. Biofeedback. Biofeedback is a unique psychological treatment in which an individual is\\nconnected to a machine (usually a computer) that allows for continuous monitoring of involuntary\\nphysiological reactions. Measurements that can be obtained are heart rate, galvanic skin response,\\nrespiration, muscle tension, and body temperature, to name a few.\\nThere are a few different ways in which biofeedback can be administered. The first is clinician-led. The\\nclinician will actively guide the patient through a relaxation monologue, encouraging the patient to\\nrelax muscles associated near the pain region (or within the entire body). While going through the'),\n",

The most\\ncommon, a program called Wild Devine (now Unyte) is an integrative relaxation program that\\nencourages the use of breathing techniques while simultaneously measuring the patient’s physiological\\nresponses. This type of programming is especially helpful for younger patients as there are various\\n“games” the child can play that requires the awareness and control of their thoughts, feelings, and\\nemotions.\\n      8.6.2.3. Hypnosis. Hypnosis, which some argue is just an extreme sense of relaxation, has been\\neffective in reducing pain and managing anxiety symptoms associated with medical procedures (Lang et\\nal., 2000). Through extensive training, an individual can learn to engage in self-hypnosis or obtain\\nrecorded hypnosis monologues to assist with the management of physiological symptoms outside of\\nhypnosis sessions. While additional research is still needed within the field of hypnosis, studies have\\nindicated that hypnosis is effective in not only treating chronic pain, but also assists with a reduction in\\nanxiety, improved sleep, and improved overall quality of life (Jensen et al., 2006).\\n      8.6.2.4. Group Therapy. Group therapy is another effective treatment option for individuals with\\npsychological distress related to physical disorders. These groups not only aim to reduce the negative\\nemotions associated with chronic illnesses, but they also provide support from other group members\\nthat are experiencing the same physical and psychological symptoms. These groups are typically CBT\\nbased and utilize cognitive and behavioral strategies in a group setting to encourage acceptance of\\ndisease while also addressing maladaptive coping strategies.\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nPsychological factors affecting other medical conditions has as its primary focus the physical\\ndisorder, and not the mental disorder.\\nThe most common types of psychophysiological disorders include headaches to include migraines\\nand tension, gastrointestinal to include ulcers and IBS, insomnia, coronary heart disease, and\\nhypertension.\\nCommon treatments for these other medical conditions include relaxation training, biofeedback,\\nhypnosis, traditional CBT treatments, and group therapy.\\n \\nSection 8.6 Review Questions\\nWhat are the most common types of psychophysiological disorders?1.\\nDiscuss the differences between the different types of headaches.2.\\nWhat is the difference between ulcers and irritable bowel syndrome?3.\\nWhat are the identified predictors to coronary heart disease and other cardiac events?4.'),\n",

Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder\\nObsessive-compulsive disorder, more commonly known as OCD, requires the presence of obsessions,\\ncompulsions, or both. Obsessions are defined as repetitive and persistent thoughts, urges, or images.\\nThese obsessions are intrusive, time-consuming (i.e., take more than an hour a day), and unwanted,\\noften causing significant distress or impairment in an individual’s daily functioning. Common obsessions\\nare contamination (dirt on self or objects), errors of uncertainty regarding daily behaviors (locking the\\ndoor, turning off appliances), thoughts of physical harm or violence, and orderliness, to name a few\\n(Cisler, Adams, et al., 2011; Yadin & Foa, 2009). Often the individual will try to ignore these thoughts,\\nurges, or images. When they are unable to ignore them, the individual will engage in compulsory\\nbehaviors to gain temporary relief from the distress or anxiety.\\nCompulsions are time-consuming, repetitive behaviors or mental acts that an individual performs in\\nresponse to an obsession. Common examples of compulsions are checking (e.g., repeatedly checking if\\nthe stove is turned off even though the first four-times they checked it was), counting (e.g., flicking the\\nlights off and on exactly five times), hand washing, symmetry, fears of harm to self or others, or\\nrepeating specific words (APA, 2022). These compulsive behaviors essentially alleviate the anxiety\\nassociated with the obsessive thoughts. For example, an individual may feel as though their hands are\\ndirty after using utensils at a restaurant. They may obsess over this thought for some time, impacting\\ntheir ability to interact with others or complete a specific task. This obsession will ultimately lead to the\\nindividual performing a compulsion where they will wash their hands with extremely hot water to rid all\\nthe germs, or even wash their hands a specified number of times if they also have a counting\\ncompulsion. At this point, the individual’s anxiety should be temporarily relieved.\\nThese obsessions and compulsions are more excessive than the typical “cleanliness” as they consume a\\nlarge part of the individual’s day. Additionally, they cause significant impairment in one’s daily\\nfunctioning. Given the example above, an individual with a fear of contamination may refuse to eat at\\nrestaurants, or they may bring their utensils from home. The frequency and severity of the obsessions\\nand compulsions varies by patient, with some having mild to moderate symptoms and only spending 1-3\\nhours a day obsessing or engaging in compulsive behaviors, while other patients present with severe\\nsymptoms and have nearly constant intrusive thoughts or compulsions that can become incapacitating\\n(APA, 2022).\\n \\n9.1.2. Body Dysmorphic Disorder\\nBody dysmorphic disorder is another obsessive disorder; however, the focus of the obsessions is with\\nperceived defects or flaws in one’s physical appearance. A key feature of these obsessions is that they\\nare not observable or appear slight to others. An individual who has a congenital facial defect or a burn\\nvictim who is concerned about their scars are not examples of an individual with body dysmorphic\\ndisorder. The obsessions related to one’s appearance can run the spectrum from feeling “unattractive”\\nto “looking hideous.” While any part of the body can be a concern for an individual with body\\ndysmorphic disorder, the most commonly reported areas are skin (acne, wrinkles, skin color), hair\\n(particularly thinning or excessive body hair), and nose (size or shape; APA, 2022). Interestingly, the'),\n",

Some individuals with body dysmorphic disorder will go as far as having\\nnumerous plastic surgeries in attempts to obtain their “perfect” appearance.\\nWhile most of us are guilty of engaging in some of these behaviors, to meet criteria for body dysmorphic\\ndisorder, one must spend a considerable amount of time preoccupied with their appearance (i.e., on\\naverage 3-8 hours a day), as well as display significant impairment in social, occupational, or other\\nareas of functioning. Some individuals excessively tan, change their clothes repeatedly, or compulsively\\nshop such as for beauty products. Camouflaging perceived defects is a common behavior and could\\ninvolve applying makeup, adjusting a hat or one’s clothes, or covering the forehead or eyes with one’s\\nhair, all to hide or cover the perceived defect or problem area (APA, 2022).\\nAs the DSM-5-TR notes, body dysmorphic disorder has been associated with, “abnormalities in emotion\\nrecognition, attention, and executive function, as well as information-processing biases and\\ninaccuracies in interpretation of information and social situations” (APA, 2022, pg. 273). These\\nindividuals tend to express a bias for negative and threatening interpretations of facial expressions and\\nsituations that would be classified as ambiguous, for instance.\\n     9.1.2.1. Muscle dysmorphia. While muscle dysmorphia is not a formal diagnosis, it is a common\\ntype of BDD, particularly within the male population. Muscle dysmorphia refers to the belief that one’s\\nbody is too small or lacks the appropriate amount of muscle definition (Ahmed, Cook, Genen &\\nSchwartz, 2014). While the severity of BDD between individuals with and without muscle dysmorphia\\nappears to be the same, some studies have found higher use of substance abuse (i.e., steroid use),\\npoorer quality of life, and increased reports of suicide attempts in those with muscle dysmorphia (Pope,\\nPope, Menard, Fay Olivardia, & Philips, 2005). The DSM-5-TR instructs clinicians to specify if body\\ndysmorphic disorder occurs with muscle dysmorphia.\\n     9.1.2.2. Insight specifiers. Those diagnosed with body dysmorphic disorder vary in the degree of\\ninsight they have about the accuracy of their body dysmorphic disorder beliefs, ranging from good to\\nabsent/delusional. On average, insight is poor and at least one-third of those diagnosed with the\\ndisorder display absent/delusional insight. Mental health professionals would indicate the degree of\\ninsight regarding body dysmorphic disorder beliefs using with good or fair insight, with poor insight, or\\nwith absent insight/delusional beliefs. See page 272 of the DSM-5-TR for more information. Note that\\nthe insight specifier is used with OCD and hoarding disorders as well.\\n \\n9.1.3. Hoarding Disorder\\nIn hoarding disorder, the key feature is the persistent over-accumulation of possessions (APA, 2022).\\nWhile we all obtain items throughout life, individuals with hoarding disorder continue to accumulate\\nitems without discarding possessions, regardless of their value or sentiment. This lack of discarding\\noccurs over a long period and is not explained by a recent significant stressor (e.g., lost house in fire, so'),\n",

For example, last week’s newspaper would likely have no relevance to you or\\npossibly any historical value, but those with hoarding disorder would keep this newspaper despite the\\nlack of value or sentiment.\\nThe most commonly hoarded items are newspapers, magazines, clothes, bags, books, mail, and\\npaperwork (APA, 2022). While these items may be stored in attics and garages, individuals with a\\nhoarding disorder also have these items cluttering their living space, sometimes to the extent that they\\nare unable to utilize their furniture because it is covered in stuff. Cognitive factors contributing to the\\nneed to hold onto these non-sentimental items are fear of losing valuable information and fear of being\\nwasteful. When asked to “clean out” their house or get rid of these items, individuals with hoarding\\ndisorder experience significant distress. Individuals with hoarding disorder display indecisiveness,\\navoidance, procrastination, perfectionism, difficulty planning and organizing tasks, and are easily\\ndistractible.\\nOne’s hoarding behaviors also impacts their daily functioning and causes impairment in social and\\noccupational functioning. It can lead to low quality of life and in extreme cases, place the individual at\\nrisk for figure, falling, poor sanitation, and other health risks.

OCD\\nThe prevalence rate for OCD is approximately 1.2% both in the U.S. and worldwide (APA, 2022). Women\\nare diagnosed with OCD more often than males; however, in childhood, boys are diagnosed more\\nfrequently than girls (APA, 2022). With respect to gender and symptoms, females are more likely to be\\ndiagnosed with cleaning related obsessions and compulsions. In contrast, males are more likely to\\ndisplay symptoms related to forbidden thoughts and symmetry (APA, 2022). The DSM-5-TR reports that\\nthe mean age of onset of OCD is 19.5 years with a quarter of cases starting by 14 years of age.\\nAdditionally, males have an earlier age of onset (5-15 yrs.) compared to females (20-24 yrs.; Rasmussen\\n& Eisen, 1990).\\n \\n9.2.2. Body Dysmorphic Disorder\\nThe point prevalence rate for body dysmorphic disorder among U.S. adults is 2.4% while outside the\\nU.S., the point prevalence is 1.7% to 2.9%. Gender-based prevalence rates indicate that women are\\nmore likely to be diagnosed with body dysmorphic disorder than men, though muscle dysmorphia is\\ndiagnosed more frequently in men. Additionally, women are more likely to be preoccupied with weight,\\nbreasts, buttocks, legs, hips, and excessive body or facial hair while men have preoccupations with their\\ngenitals, body build, and thinning hair (APA, 2022).\\n \\n9.2.3.

Biological\\nThere are a few biological explanations for obsessive-compulsive related disorders, including hereditary\\ntransmission, neurotransmitter deficits, and abnormal functioning in brain structures.\\n     9.4.1.1. Hereditary transmission. With regards to heritability studies, twin studies routinely\\nsupport the role of genetics in the development of obsessive-compulsive behaviors, as monozygotic\\ntwins have a substantially greater concordance rate (80-87%) than dizygotic twins (47-50%; Carey &\\nGottesman, 1981; van Grootheest, Cath, Beekman, & Boomsma, 2005).  Additionally, first degree\\nrelatives of patients diagnosed with OCD are at a 5-fold increase to develop OCD at some point\\nthroughout their lifespan (Nestadt, et al., 2000).\\nInterestingly, a study conducted by Nestadt and colleagues (2000) exploring the familial role in the\\ndevelopment of obsessive-compulsive disorder found that family members of individuals with OCD had\\nhigher rates of both obsessions and compulsions than control families; however, the familial\\nrelationship with regards to obsessions were stronger than that of compulsions suggesting that there is\\na stronger heritability association for obsessions than compulsions.\\nThis study also found a relationship between age of onset of OCD symptoms and family heritability.\\nIndividuals who experienced an earlier age of onset, particularly before age 17, were found to have\\nmore first-degree relatives diagnosed with OCD. In fact, after the age of 17, there was no relationship\\nbetween family diagnoses, suggesting those who develop OCD at an older age may have a different\\ndiagnostic origin (Nestadt, et al., 2000).\\nInitial studies exploring genetic factors for BDD and hoarding also indicate a hereditary influence;\\nhowever, environmental factors appear to play a more significant role in the development of these\\ndisorders than that of OCD (Ahmed, et al., 2014; Lervolino et al., 2009).\\n     9.4.1.2. Neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters, particularly serotonin, have been identified as a\\ncontributing factor to obsessive and compulsive behaviors. This discovery was made accidentally, when\\nindividuals with depression and comorbid OCD were given antidepressant medications clomipramine'),\n",

Not\\nonly did these patients report a significant reduction in their depressive symptoms, but also a\\nsubstantial improvement in their OCD symptoms (Bokor & Anderson, 2014). Antidepressant\\nmedications that do not affect serotonin levels are not effective in managing obsessive and compulsive\\nsymptoms, thus offering additional support for deficits of serotonin levels as an explanation of obsessive\\nand compulsive behaviors (Sinopoli, Burton, Kronenberg, & Arnold, 2017; Bokor & Anderson, 2014).\\nMore recently, there has been some research implicating the involvement of additional\\nneurotransmitters—glutamate, GABA, and dopamine—in the development and maintenance of OCD,\\nalthough future studies are still needed to draw definitive conclusions (Marinova, Chuang, & Fineberg,\\n2017).\\n     9.4.1.3. Brain structures. Seeing as neurotransmitters have direct involvement in the\\ndevelopment of obsessive-compulsive behaviors, it’s only logical that brain structures that house these\\nneurotransmitters also likely play a role in symptom development. Neuroimaging studies implicate the\\nbrain structures and circuits in the frontal lobe, more specifically, the orbitofrontal cortex, which is\\nlocated just above each eye (Marsh et al., 2014). This brain region is responsible for mediating strong\\nemotional responses and converts them into behavioral responses. Once the orbitofrontal cortex\\nreceives sensory/emotional information via sensory inputs, it transmits this information through\\nimpulses. These impulses are then passed on to the caudate nuclei, which filters through the many\\nimpulses received, passing along only the strongest impulses to the thalamus. Once the impulses reach\\nthe thalamus, the individual essentially reassesses the emotional response and decides whether to act\\n(Beucke et al., 2013). It is believed that individuals with obsessive compulsive behaviors experience\\noveractivity of the orbitofrontal cortex and a lack of filtering in the caudate nuclei, thus causing too\\nmany impulses to transfer to the thalamus (Endrass et al., 2011). Further support for this theory has\\nbeen shown when individuals with OCD experience brain damage to the orbitofrontal cortex or caudate\\nnuclei and experience remission of OCD symptoms (Hofer et al., 2013).\\n \\n9.4.2. Cognitive\\nCognitive theorists believe that OCD behaviors occur due to an individual’s distorted thinking and\\nnegative cognitive biases. More specifically, individuals with OCD are more likely to overestimate the\\nprobability of harm, loss of control, or uncertainty in their life, thus leading them to over-interpret\\npotential negative outcomes of events. Additionally, some research has indicated that those with OCD\\nalso experience disconfirmation bias, which causes the individual to seek out evidence of their failure to\\nperform the ritual or compensatory behavior correctly (Sue, Sue, Sue, & Sue, 2017). Finally, individuals\\nwith OCD often report the inability to trust themselves and their instincts, and therefore, feel the need\\nto repeat the compulsive behavior multiple times to ensure it is done correctly. These cognitive biases\\nare supported throughout research studies that repeatedly find individuals with OCD experience more\\nintrusive thoughts than those without OCD (Jacob, Larson, & Storch, 2014).\\nWe have shown that individuals with OCD experience cognitive biases and that these biases contribute\\nto the obsessive and compulsive behaviors, but why do these cognitive biases occur so often? Everyone\\nhas times when they have repetitive or intrusive thoughts such as: “Did I shut the oven off after cooking\\ndinner?” or “Did I remember to lock the door before I left home?” Fortunately, most individuals are able\\nto either concede to their thoughts once, or even forgo acknowledging their thoughts after they\\nconfidently talk themselves through their actions, ensuring that the behavior in question was or was not'),\n",

Unfortunately, individuals with OCD are unable to neutralize these thoughts without\\nperforming a ritual as a way to put themselves at ease. As you will see in more detail in the behavioral\\nsection below, the behaviors (compulsions) used to neutralize the thoughts (obsessions) provide\\ntemporary relief to the individual. As the individual is continually exposed to the obsession and\\nrepeatedly engages in the compulsive behaviors to neutralize their anxiety, the behavior is repeatedly\\nreinforced, thus becoming a compulsion. This theory is supported by studies where individuals with\\nOCD report using more neutralizing strategies and report significant reductions in anxiety after\\nemploying these neutralizing techniques (Jacob, Larson, & Storch, 2014; Salkovskis et al., 2003).\\n \\n9.4.3. Behavioral\\nThe behavioral explanation of obsessive compulsive-related disorders focuses on compulsions rather\\nthan obsessions. Behaviorists believe that these compulsions begin with and are maintained through\\noperant conditioning. How so? Well, an individual with OCD may experience negative thoughts or\\nanxieties related to an unpleasant event (obsession; the event is a stimulus). These thoughts/anxieties\\ncause significant distress to the individual, and therefore, they seek out some behavior (compulsion; the\\nresponse) to alleviate these threats (i.e., escape behavior associated with negative reinforcement). This\\nprovides temporary relief to the individual, thus reinforcing the compulsive behaviors used to lessen the\\nthreat. Over time, the compulsive behaviors are reinforced due to the repeated exposure of the\\nobsession and the temporary relief that comes with engaging in these compulsive behaviors (escape\\nbehavior).\\nStrong support for this theory is the fact that the behavioral treatment option for OCD- exposure and\\nresponse prevention, is among the most effective treatments for these disorders. As you will read below,\\nthis treatment essentially breaks the patient’s operant conditioning associated with the obsessions and\\ncompulsions by preventing the individual from engaging in the compulsive behavior until anxiety is\\nreduced.\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nBiological causes of obsessive-compulsive disorders include hereditary transmission,\\nneurotransmitter deficits particularly in relation to serotonin, and abnormal functioning in brain\\nstructures.\\nCognitive causes of obsessive-compulsive disorders include distorted thinking such as\\noverestimating the probability of harm, loss of control, or uncertainty in their life, and negative\\ncognitive biases such as disconfirmation bias.\\nBehavioral causes of obsessive-compulsive disorders include operant conditioning.\\n \\nSection 9.4 Review Questions'),\n",

OCD\\n     9.5.1.1. Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP). Treatment of OCD has come a long way in\\nrecent years. Among the most effective treatment options is exposure and response prevention (March,\\nFrances, Kahn, & Carpenter, 1997). First developed by psychiatrist Victor Meyer (1966), as you might\\ninfer from the name, individuals are repeatedly exposed to their obsession, thus causing anxiety/fears,\\nwhile simultaneously prevented from engaging in their compulsive behaviors. Exposure sessions are\\noften done in vivo (in real life), via videos, or even imaginary, depending on the type of obsession. For\\nexample, a fear that one’s house would burn down if their compulsion was not carried out would\\nobviously be done via imaginary exposure, as it would not be ethical to have a person burn their house\\ndown.\\nPrior to beginning the exposure and response prevention exercises, the clinician must teach the patient\\nrelaxation techniques for them to engage in during the distress of being exposed to the obsession. Once\\nrelaxation techniques are taught, the clinician and patient will develop a hierarchy of obsessions.\\nTreatment will start at those with the lowest amount of distress to ensure the patient has success with\\ntreatment, as well as preventing withdrawal of treatment.\\nWithin the hierarchy of obsessions, the individual is also gradually exposed to their obsession. For\\nexample, an individual obsessed with germs, may first watch a person sneeze on the computer in\\nsession. Once anxiety is managed and compulsions refrain at this level of exposure, the individual would\\nmove on to being present in the same room as a sick individual, to eventually shaking hands with'),\n",

Once\\nthis level of their hierarchy was managed, they would move on to the next obsession and so forth until\\nthe entire list was complete.\\nTreatment outcome for exposure and response prevention is very effective in treating individuals with\\nOCD. In fact, some studies suggest up to an 86% response rate when treatment is completed (Foa et al.,\\n2005). Combination treatments such as ERP with family counseling (utilizing CBT techniques) may\\nincrease this response rate even higher (Bolleau, 2011; Krebs & Heyman, 2015). Like most OCD related\\ntreatments, the largest barrier to treatment is getting patients to commit to treatment, as the repeated\\nexposures and prevention of compulsive behaviors can be extremely distressing to patients.\\n     9.5.1.2. Psychopharmacology. There has been minimal support for the treatment of OCD with\\nmedication alone. This is likely due to the temporary resolution of symptoms during medication use.\\nAmong the most effective medications are those that inhibit the reuptake of serotonin, clomipramine\\nand SSRIs. Reportedly, up to 60% of patients show improvement in symptoms while taking these\\nmedications; however, symptoms are quick to return when medications are discontinued (Dougherty,\\nRauch, & Jenike, 2002). While there has been some promise in a combined treatment option of exposure\\nand response prevention and SSRIs, these findings were not superior to exposure and response\\nprevention alone, suggesting that the inclusion of medication in treatment does not provide an added\\nbenefit (Foa et al., 2005).\\n \\n9.5.2. Body Dysmorphic Disorder\\nSeeing as though there are strong similarities between OCD and body dysmorphic disorder, it should\\nnot come as a surprise that the only two effective treatments for body dysmorphic disorder are those\\nthat are effective in OCD. Exposure and response prevention has been successful in treating symptoms\\nof body dysmorphic disorder, as patients are repeatedly exposed to their body imperfections/obsessions\\nand prevented from engaging in compulsions used to reduce their anxiety.  (Veale, Gournay, et al.,\\n1996; Wilhelm, Otto, Lohr, & Deckersbach, 1999). The other treatment option, psychopharmacology,\\nhas also been shown to reduce symptoms in patients with body dysmorphic disorder. Similar to OCD,\\nmedications such as clomipramine and SSRIs are generally prescribed. While these are effective in\\nreducing body dysmorphic disorder symptoms, once medication is discontinued, symptoms resume\\nnearly immediately suggesting this is not an effective long-term treatment option for those with body\\ndysmorphic disorder.\\nTreatment of body dysmorphic disorder appears to be difficult, with one study finding that only 9% of\\nparticipants had full remission at a 1-year follow-up, and 21% reported partial remission (Phillips,\\nPagano, Menard & Stout, 2006). A more recent finding reported more promising findings, with 76% of\\nparticipants reporting full remission over 8 years (Bjornsson, Dyck, et al., 2011).\\n     9.5.2.1. Plastic surgery and medical treatments. Many individuals with body dysmorphic\\ndisorder seek out plastic surgery to attempt to correct their deficits. Phillips and colleagues (2001)\\nevaluated treatments of patients with body dysmorphic disorder and found that 76.4% of the patients\\nreported some form of plastic surgery or medical treatment, with dermatology treatment the most\\nreported (45%) followed by plastic surgery (23%). The problem with this type of treatment is that the\\nindividual is rarely satisfied with the outcome of the procedure, thus leading them to seek out additional\\nsurgeries on the same defect (Phillips et al., 2001). Therefore, it is important that medical professionals'),\n",

Hoarding Disorder\\nRecent research has concluded that unlike OCD, many individuals with hoarding disorder do not\\nexperience intrusive thoughts, nor do they experience urges to perform rituals. Because of this\\ndifference, treatment for hoarding disorder has moved away from exposure and response prevention,\\nand more toward a traditional cognitive-behavioral approach.\\nFrost and Hartl (1996) believed that individuals with hoarding disorder engage in complex decision-\\nmaking processes, overanalyzing the value and worth of possessions, thus leading to hoarding the\\nobject as opposed to discarding it. Therefore, in addition to having the individual engage in exposure\\ntreatment, an added component of cognitive restructuring and motivational interviewing are added to\\naddress the complex-decision making that is involved in maintaining unnecessary possessions. By\\ndiscussing motives for keeping items, as well as fears that may be associated with discarding items,\\nclinicians can assist patients in their cognitive processes to ultimately determine the item’s actual worth\\n(Williams & Viscusi, 2016). Unfortunately, due to the distressing nature of having to discard their\\npossessions, many individuals in treatment for hoarding disorder prematurely end treatment, thus never\\nreaching remission of symptoms (Mancebo, Eisen, Sibrava, Dyck, & Rasmussen, 2011).\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nTreatment options for OCD include exposure and response prevention, as well as SSRIs though\\nthe drug does not provide an added benefit in treatment.\\nTreatment options for body dysmorphic disorder include exposure and response prevention and\\ndrugs clomipramine and SSRIs.\\nTreatment options for hoarding disorder include exposure treatment, cognitive restructuring, and\\nmotivational interviewing.\\n \\nSection 9.5 Review Questions\\nDiscuss the various types of treatments for OCD.

They are very serious, yet\\nrelatively common mental health disorders, particularly in Western society, where there is a heavy\\nemphasis on thinness and physical appearance. In fact, 13% of adolescents will be diagnosed with at\\nleast one eating disorder by their 20th birthday (Stice, Marti, & Rohde, 2013). Furthermore, a large\\nnumber of adolescents will engage in significant disordered eating behaviors just below the clinical\\nthreshold (Culbert, Burt, McGue, Iacono & Klump, 2009). While there is no exact cause for eating\\ndisorders, the combination of biological, psychological, and sociocultural factors has been identified as\\nmajor contributors in both the development and maintenance of eating disorders.\\nWithin the DSM 5-TR (APA, 2022), six disorders are classified under the Feeding and Eating Disorders\\nchapter: pica, rumination disorder, avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder, anorexia nervosa, bulimia\\nnervosa, and binge-eating disorder. In this module, we will cover the latter three whose diagnostic\\ncriteria are mutually exclusive, meaning that only one of these diagnoses can be assigned at any given\\ntime due to substantial differences in their clinical course, outcome, and treatment needs, despite a\\nnumber of common psychological and behavioral features.

Anorexia Nervosa\\nAnorexia nervosa involves the restriction of energy intake, which leads to significantly low body weight\\nrelative to the individual’s age, sex, and development. This restriction is often secondary to an intense\\nfear of gaining weight or becoming fat, despite the individual’s low body weight. Altered perception of\\nself and an over-evaluation of one’s body weight and shape contribute to this disturbance of body size.\\nTypical warning signs and symptoms are divided into two different categories: emotional/behavioral and\\nphysical. Some emotional and behavioral symptoms include dramatic weight loss; preoccupation with\\nfood, weight, calories, etc.; frequent comments about feeling “fat;” eating a restricted range of foods;\\nmaking excuses to avoid mealtimes; and not eating in public. Physical changes may include dizziness,\\ndifficulty concentrating, feeling cold, sleep problems, thinning hair/hair loss, and muscle weakness, to\\nname a few. When the individual loses weight, they view this as an impressive achievement and a sign\\nof extraordinary discipline, while weight gain is seen as an unacceptable failure of self-control (APA,\\n2022).\\nThe onset of the disorder typically begins with mild dietary restrictions such as eliminating carbs or\\nspecific fatty foods. As weight loss is achieved, the dietary restrictions progress to more severe, e.g.,\\nunder 500 calories/day.  Symptoms present in adolescence or young adulthood and rarely before'),\n",

Bulimia Nervosa\\nUnlike anorexia nervosa where there is solely restriction of food, bulimia nervosa involves a pattern of\\nrecurrent binge eating behaviors. Binge eating can be defined as a discrete period of time where the\\namount of food consumed is significantly more than most people would eat during a similar time period.\\nIndividuals with bulimia nervosa often report a sense of lack of control over-eating during these binge-\\neating episodes. While not always the case, these binge-eating episodes are followed by a feeling of\\ndisgust with oneself, which leads to a compensatory behavior to rid the body of the excessive calories.\\nThese compensatory behaviors include vomiting, use of laxatives, fasting (or severe restriction),\\ndiuretics or other medications, or excessive exercise. This cycle of binge eating and compensatory\\nbehaviors occurs on average, at least once a week for three months (National Eating Disorder\\nAssociation website; APA, 2022).\\nIt is important to note that while there are periods of severe calorie restriction like anorexia, the two\\ndisorders cannot be diagnosed simultaneously. Therefore, it is important to determine the individual’s\\nweight when distinguishing between anorexia and bulimia. If an individual has a significantly low body\\nweight and engages in binge/purging behaviors, the diagnosis is anorexia; if the individual does not\\nhave a significantly low body weight and engages in binge/purging behaviors, the diagnosis is bulimia.\\nSigns and symptoms of bulimia nervosa are similar to anorexia nervosa. These symptoms include but\\nare not limited to hiding food wrappers or containers after a bingeing episode, feeling uncomfortable\\neating in public, developing food rituals, limited diet, disappearing to the bathroom after eating a meal,\\nand drinking excessive amounts of water or non-caloric beverages. Additional physical changes include\\nweight fluctuations both up and down, difficulty concentrating, dizziness, sleep disturbance, and\\npossible dental problems due to purging post binge eating episode.\\nMaking Sense of the Disorders\\nThough anorexia and bulimia share some common features, they differ as follows:\\nDiagnosis anorexia …… if significantly low body weight with severe calorie restriction\\nDiagnosis bulimia … if body weight is within normal range but displays calorie restriction AND\\nbinge-eating episodes\\nSymptoms of bulimia nervosa typically present later in development – adolescence or early adulthood.\\nLike anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa initially presents with mild restrictive dietary behaviors;\\nhowever, episodes of binge eating interrupt the dietary restriction, causing bodyweight to rise around'),\n",

Binge-Eating Disorder (BED)\\nBinge-eating disorder is similar to bulimia nervosa in that it involves recurrent binge eating episodes\\nalong with feelings of lack of control during the binge-eating episode. The binge-eating episodes are\\nassociated with at least three of the following: eating quicker than usual, eating until uncomfortably\\nfull, eating large amounts even if not hungry, eating alone, and feeling disgust with oneself or being\\ndepressed. Despite the feelings of shame and guilt post-binge, individuals with BED will not engage in\\nvomiting, excessive exercise, or other compensatory behaviors. These binge eating episodes occur on\\naverage, at least once a week for 3 months.\\nBecause these binge-eating episodes occur without compensatory behaviors, individuals with BED are\\nat risk for obesity and related health disorders. Individuals with BED report feelings of embarrassment\\nat the quantity of food consumed, and thus will often refuse to eat in public. Due to the restriction of\\neating around others, individuals with BED often engage in secret binge eating episodes in private,\\nfollowed by discrete disposal of wrappers and containers.\\nMaking Sense of the Disorders\\nThough bulimia and BED are similar, they differ as follows:\\nDiagnosis BED …… if binge eating occurs WITHOUT compensatory behaviors\\nDiagnosis bulimia … if binge eating occurs AND there are compensatory behaviors to prevent\\nweight gain\\nWhile much is still being researched about binge-eating disorder, current research indicates that the\\nonset of BED is adolescence to early adulthood but can begin later in life. Those who seek treatment\\ntend to be older than those with either bulimia or anorexia. Binge eating has been found to be common\\nin adolescent and college-age samples and for all, is associated with social role adjustment issues,\\nimpaired health-related quality of life and life satisfaction, and increased medical morbidity and\\nmortality (APA, 2022).'),\n",

Unfortunately, there is also a high rate of suicidality, with rates reported to be 18 times\\ngreater than in an age- and gender-matched comparison group.

While researchers have yet to identify a specific cause of eating\\ndisorders, the most compelling argument to date is that eating disorders are multidimensional\\ndisorders. This means many contributing factors lead to the development of an eating disorder. While\\nthere is likely a genetic predisposition, there are also environmental, or external factors, such as family\\ndynamics and cultural influences that impact their presentation. Research supporting these influences\\nis well documented for anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa; however, seeing as BED has only just\\nrecently been established as a formal diagnosis, research on the evolvement of BED is ongoing.\\n \\n10.4.1. Biological\\nThere is some evidence of a genetic predisposition for eating disorders, with relatives of those\\ndiagnosed with an eating disorder being up to six times more likely than other individuals to be\\ndiagnosed also. Twin concordance studies also support the gene theory. If an identical twin is diagnosed\\nwith anorexia, there is a 70% percent chance the other twin will develop anorexia in their lifetime. The\\nconcordance rate for fraternal twins (who share less genes) is 20%. While not as strong for bulimia,\\nidentical twins still display a 23% concordance rate, compared to the 9% rate for fraternal twins.\\nIn addition to hereditary causes, disruption in the neuroendocrine system is common in those with\\neating disorders (Culbert, Racine, & Klump, 2015). Unfortunately, it’s difficult for researchers to\\ndetermine if these disruptions caused the disorder or have been caused by the disorder, as\\nmanipulation of eating patterns is known to trigger changes in hormone production. With that said,\\nresearchers have explored the hypothalamus as a potential contributing factor. The hypothalamus is\\nresponsible for regulating body functions, particularly hunger and thirst (Fetissov & Mequid, 2010).\\nWithin the hypothalamus, the lateral hypothalamus is responsible for initiating hunger cues that cause\\nthe organism to eat, whereas the ventromedial hypothalamus is responsible for sending signals of\\nsatiation, telling the organism to stop eating. Clearly, a disruption in either of these structures could\\nexplain why an individual may not take in enough calories or experience periods of overeating.\\n \\n10.4.2. Cognitive\\nSome argue that eating disorders are, in fact, a variant of obsessive-compulsive disorder  (OCD). The\\nobsession with body shape and weight—the hallmark of an eating disorder—is likely a driving factor in\\nanorexia nervosa. Distorted thought patterns and an over-evaluation of body size likely contribute to\\nthis obsession and one’s desire for thinness. Research has identified high levels of impulsivity,\\nparticularly in those with binge eating episodes, suggesting a temporary lack of control is responsible\\nfor these episodes. Post binge-eating episode, many individuals report feelings of disgust or even\\nthoughts of failure. These strong cognitive factors are indicative as to why cognitive-behavioral therapy\\nis the preferred treatment for eating disorders.\\n \\n10.4.3. Sociocultural\\nEating disorders are overwhelmingly found in Western countries where there is a heavy emphasis on\\nthinness—a core feature of eating disorders. It is also found in countries where food is in abundance, as'),\n",

While\\neating disorders were once thought of as disorders of higher SES, recent research suggests that as our\\ncountry becomes more homogenized, the more universal eating disorders become.\\n     10.4.3.1. Media. One commonly discussed contributor to eating disorders is the media. The\\nidealization of thin models and actresses sends the message to young women (and adolescents) that to\\nbe popular and attractive, you must be thin. These images are not isolated to magazines, but are also\\nseen in television shows, movies, commercials, and large advertisements on billboards and hanging in\\nstore windows. With the emergence of social media (e.g., Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram), exposure to\\nmedia images and celebrities is even easier.  Couple this with the ability to alter images to make\\nindividuals even thinner, it is no wonder many young people become dissatisfied with their body (Polivy\\n& Herman, 2004).\\n     10.4.3.2. Ethnicity. While eating disorders are not solely a “white woman” disorder, there are\\nsignificant discrepancies when it comes to race, especially for anorexia nervosa. Why is this? Research\\nindicates that black men prefer heavier women than do white men (Greenberg & Laporte, 1996). Given\\nthis preference, it should not be surprising that black women and children have larger ideal physiques\\nthan their white peers (Polivy & Herman, 2000). Since black women are less driven to thinness, black\\nwomen would appear to be less likely to develop anorexia; however, findings suggest this is not the\\ncase. Caldwell and colleagues (1997) found that high-income black women were equally as dissatisfied\\nas high-income white women with their physique, suggesting body image issues may be more closely\\nrelated to SES than that of race. The race discrepancies are also less significant in BED, where the\\nprominent feature of the eating disorder is not thinness (Polivy & Herman, 2002).\\n     10.4.3.3. Gender. Males account for only a small percentage of eating disorders. While it is unclear\\nas to why there is such a discrepancy, it is likely somewhat related to cultural desires of women being\\n“thin” and men being “muscular” or “strong.”\\nOf men diagnosed with an eating disorder, the overwhelming percentage of them identified a job or\\nsport as the primary reason for their eating behaviors (Strother, Lemberg, Stanford, & Turberville,\\n2012). Jockeys, distance runners, wrestlers, and bodybuilders are some of the professions identified as\\nmost restrictive regarding body weight.\\nThere is some speculation that males are not diagnosed as frequently as women due to the stigma\\nattached to eating disorders. Eating disorders have routinely been characterized as a “white, adolescent\\nfemale” problem. Due to this bias, young men may not seek help for their eating disorder in efforts to\\nprevent labeling (Raevuoni, Keski-Rahkonen & Hoek, 2014).\\n     10.4.3.4. Family. Family influences are one of the strongest external contributors to maintaining\\neating disorders. Often family members are praised for their slenderness. Think about the last time you\\nsaw a family member or close friend- how often have you said, “You look great!” or commented on their\\nappearance in some way? The odds are likely high. While the intent of the family member is not to\\nmaintain maladaptive eating behaviors by praising the physical appearance of someone struggling with\\nan eating disorder, they are indirectly perpetuating the disorder.\\nWhile family involvement can help maintain the disorder, it can also contribute to the development of an\\neating disorder. Families that emphasize thinness or place a large emphasis on physical appearance are\\nmore likely to have a child diagnosed with an eating disorder (Zerbe, 2008). In fact, mothers with eating\\ndisorders are more likely to have children who develop a feeding/eating disorder than mothers without'),\n",

Additional family characteristics that are common among\\npatients receiving treatment for eating disorders are enmeshed, intrusive, critical, hostile, or overly\\nconcerned with parenting (Polivy & Herman, 2002). While there has been some correlation between\\nthese family dynamics and eating disorders, they are not evident in all families of people with eating\\ndisorders.\\n \\n10.4.4. Personality\\nThere are many personality characteristics that are common in individuals with eating disorders. While\\nit is unknown if these characteristics are inherent in the individual’s personality or a product of\\npersonal experiences, the thought is eating disorders develop due to the combination of the two.\\n     10.4.4.1. Perfectionism. It should come as no surprise that perfectionism, or the belief that one\\nmust be perfect, is a contributing factor to disorders related to eating, weight, and body shape\\n(particularly anorexia nervosa). While an exact mechanism is unknown, it is believed that perfectionism\\nmagnifies normal body imperfections, leading an individual to go to extreme (i.e., restrictive) behaviors\\nto remedy the flaw (Hewitt, Flett & Ediger, 1995).\\n     10.4.4.2. Self-Esteem. Self-esteem, or one’s belief in their worth or ability, has routinely been\\nidentified as a moderator of many psychological disorders, and eating disorders are no exception. Low\\nself-esteem not only contributes to the development of an eating disorder but is also likely involved in\\nthe maintenance of the disorder. One theory, the transdiagnostic model of eating disorders, suggests\\nthat overall low self-esteem increases the risk for over-evaluation of body, which in turn, leads to\\nnegative eating behaviors that could lead to an eating disorder (Fairburn, Cooper & Shafran, 2003).\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nBiological causes of eating disorders include a genetic predisposition and disruption in the\\nneuroendocrine system.\\nCognitive causes of eating disorders include distorted thought patterns and an over-evaluation of\\nbody size.\\nSociocultural causes of eating disorders include the idealization of thin models and actresses by\\nthe media, SES, gender, and family involvement.\\nThe personality trait of perfectionism and low self-esteem are contributing factors to disorders\\nrelated to eating, weight, and body shape.\\n \\nSection 10.4 Review Questions\\nDefine multidimensional disorders?1.\\nWhat evidence is there to suggest eating disorders are biologically driven?2.'),\n",

This is often established via an intensive outpatient program, or if needed, through an\\ninpatient hospitalization program where caloric intake can be managed and controlled. Both the\\ninpatient and outpatient programs use a combination of therapies and support to help restore proper\\neating habits. Of the most common (and successful) treatments are Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)\\nand Family-Based Therapy (FBT).\\n     10.5.1.1. CBT. Because anorexia nervosa requires changes to both eating behaviors as well as\\nthought patterns, CBT strategies have been very effective in producing lasting changes to those\\nsuffering from anorexia nervosa. Some of the behavioral strategies include recording eating\\nbehaviors—hunger pains, quality and quantity of food—and emotional behaviors—feelings related to the\\nfood. In addition to these behavioral strategies, it is also important to address the maladaptive thought\\npatterns associated with their negative body image and desire to control their physical characteristics.\\nChanging the fear related to gaining weight is essential in recovery.\\n     10.5.1.2. Family based therapy (FBT). FBT is also an effective treatment approach, often used as\\na component of individual CBT, especially for children and adolescents with the disorder.

While FBT has shown to be effective in treating\\nadolescents with anorexia nervosa, the application for older eating patients (i.e., college-aged students\\nand above) is still undetermined. As with adolescents, the goal for a family-based treatment program\\nshould center around helping the patient separate their feelings and needs from that of their family.\\n \\n10.5.2. Bulimia Nervosa\\nJust as anorexia nervosa treatment initially focuses on weight gain, the first goal of bulimia nervosa\\ntreatment is to eliminate binge eating episodes and compensatory behaviors. The aim is to replace both\\nnegative behaviors with positive eating habits. One of the most effective ways to establish this is\\nthrough Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).\\n     10.5.2.1. CBT. Similar to anorexia nervosa, individuals with bulimia nervosa are expected to keep a\\njournal of their eating habits; however, with bulimia nervosa, it is also important that the journal\\ninclude changes in sensations of hunger and fullness, as well as other feelings surrounding their eating\\npatterns in efforts to identify triggers to their binging episodes (Agras, Fitzsimmons-Craft & Wilfley,\\n2017). Once these triggers are identified, psychologists will utilize specific behavioral or cognitive\\ntechniques to prevent the individual from engaging in binge episodes or compensatory behaviors.\\nOne method for modifying behaviors is through Exposure and Response Prevention. As previously\\ndiscussed in the OCD chapter, this treatment is very effective in helping individuals stop performing\\ntheir compulsive behaviors by literally preventing them from engaging in the action, while\\nsimultaneously using relaxation strategies to reduce anxiety associated with not engaging in the\\nnegative behavior. Therefore, to prevent an individual from purging post-binge episodes, the individual\\nwould be encouraged to partake in an activity that directly competes with their ability to purge, e.g.,\\nwrite their thoughts and feelings in a journal at the kitchen table. Research has indicated that this\\ntreatment is particularly helpful for individuals suffering from comorbid anxiety disorders (particularly\\nOCD; Agras, Fitzsimmons-Craft & Wilfley, 2017).\\nIn addition to changing behaviors, it is also important to change the maladaptive thoughts toward food,\\neating, weight, and shape. Negative thoughts such as “I am fat” and “I can’t stop eating when I start”\\ncan be modified into more appropriate thoughts such as “My body is healthy” or “I can control my\\neating habits.”  By replacing these negative thoughts with more appropriate, positive thought patterns,\\nindividuals begin to control their feelings, which in return, can help them manage their behaviors.\\n     10.5.2.2. Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT). IPT has also been established as an effective\\ntreatment for those with bulimia nervosa, particularly if an individual has not been successful with CBT\\ntreatment. The goal of IPT is to improve interpersonal functioning in those with eating disorders.\\nOriginally a treatment for depression, IPT-E was adapted to address the social isolation and self-esteem\\nproblems that contribute to the maintenance of negative eating behaviors.\\nIPT-E has 3 phases typically covered in weekly sessions over 4-5 months. Phase One consists of\\nengaging the patient in treatment and providing psychoeducation about their disease and the treatment\\nprogram. This phase also includes identifying interpersonal problems that are maintaining the disease.'),\n",

In this phase, the primary focus is on problem-solving\\ninterpersonal issues. The most common types of interpersonal issues are lack of intimacy and\\ninterpersonal deficits, interpersonal role disputes, role transitions, grief, and life goals. Once the main\\ninterpersonal problem is identified, the clinician supports the patient in their pursuit to identify ways to\\nchange. A key component of IPT-E is the supportive role of the clinician, as opposed to the teaching role\\nin other treatments. The idea is that by having the patient make changes, they can better understand\\ntheir problems, and as a result, make more profound changes (Murphy, Straebler, Basden, Cooper, &\\nFairburn, 2012).\\nPhase Three is the final stage. The goals of this phase are to ensure that the changes made in Phase two\\nare maintained. To achieve this, treatment sessions are spaced out, allowing patients more time to\\nengage in their changed behavior. Additionally, relapse prevention (i.e., problem-solving ways not to\\nrelapse) is also discussed to ensure long term results. In doing this, the patient reviews the progress\\nthey have made throughout treatment, as well as identifying potential interpersonal issues that may\\narise, and how their treatment can be adapted to address those issues.\\nSupport for IPT-E is limited; however, two extensive studies suggest that IPT-E is effective in treating\\nbulimia nervosa, and possibly BED. While treatment is initially slower than CBT, it is equally effective in\\nlong-term follow-up and maintenance of disorder (Fairburn, Marcus, & Wilson, 1993).\\n \\n10.5.3. Binge Eating Disorder\\nGiven the similar presentations of BED and bulimia nervosa, it should not be surprising that the most\\neffective treatments for BED are similar to that of bulimia nervosa. CBT, along with antidepressant\\nmedications, are among the most effective in treating BED. Interpersonal therapy, as well as dialectical\\nbehavioral therapy, have also been effective in reducing binge-eating episodes; however, they have not\\nbeen effective in weight loss (Guerdjikova, Mori, Casuto, & McElroy, 2017). Goals of treatment are, of\\ncourse, to eliminate binge eating episodes, as well as reduce body weight as most individuals with BED\\nare overweight. Seeing as BED has only recently been established as a separate eating disorder,\\ntreatment research specific to this disorder is expected to grow.\\n     10.5.3.1. Antidepressant medications. Given the high comorbidity between eating disorders and\\ndepressive symptoms, antidepressants have been a primary method of treatment for years. While they\\nhave been shown to improve depressive symptoms, which may help individuals make gains in their\\neating disorder treatment, research has not supported antidepressants as an effective treatment\\nstrategy for treating the eating disorder itself.\\n \\n10.5.4. Outcome of Treatment\\nNow that we have discussed treatments for eating disorders, how effective are they? Research has\\nindicated favorable prognostic features for anorexia nervosa are early age of onset and a short history\\nof the disorder. Conversely, unfavorable features are a long history of symptoms prior to treatment,\\nsevere weight loss, and binge eating and vomiting. The mortality rate over the first 10 years from\\npresentation is about 10%. Most of these deaths are from medical complications due to the disorder or\\nsuicide.'),\n",

Defining Terms and Adding Context\\nSubstance-related and addictive disorders are among the most prevalent psychological disorders, with\\nroughly 100 million people in the United States reporting the use of an illegal substance sometime\\nthroughout their life (SAMHSA, 2014). It is worth noting that the DSM-5 shifted terminology from drug\\naddiction to substance use disorder, “…to describe the wide range of the disorder, from a mild form to a\\nsevere state of chronically relapsing, compulsive pattern of drug taking.” The DSM-5 acknowledges that\\nmany clinicians will use the term drug addiction to describe more severe presentations, but it is omitted\\nfrom the DSM-5 due to “…its uncertain definition and its potentially negative connotation” (APA, 2022,\\npg. 543).\\nWhat are substances? Substances are any ingested materials that cause temporary cognitive,\\nbehavioral, or physiological symptoms within the individual. The DSM uses 10 classes of substances:\\nalcohol, caffeine, cannabis, hallucinogens, inhalants, opioids, sedatives, stimulants, tobacco, and other\\n(or unknown).\\nRepeated use of these substances or frequent substance intoxication can develop into a long-term\\nproblem known as substance abuse. Abuse occurs when an individual consumes the substance for an\\nextended period or must ingest large amounts of the substance to get the same effect a substance\\nprovided previously. The need to continually increase the amount of ingested substance is known as\\ntolerance. As tolerance builds, additional physical and psychological symptoms present, often causing\\nsignificant disturbances in an individual’s personal and professional life. Individuals with substance\\nabuse often spend a significant amount of time engaging in activities that revolve around their\\nsubstance use, thus spending less time in recreational activities that once consumed their time.\\nSometimes, there is a desire to reduce or abstain from substance use; however, cravings and\\nwithdrawal symptoms often prohibit this from occurring. Common withdrawal symptoms include, but\\nare not limited to, cramps, anxiety attacks, sweating, nausea, tremors, and hallucinations. Depending on\\nthe substance and the tolerance level, most withdrawal symptoms last anywhere from a few days to a\\nweek. For those with extensive substance abuse or abuse of multiple substances, withdrawal should be\\nclosely monitored in a hospital setting to avoid severe consequences such as seizures, stroke, or even\\ndeath.\\nAccording to the DSM-5-TR (APA, 2022), the substance-related disorders are divided into two groups:\\nsubstance use disorders and substance-induced disorders which include substance intoxication and\\nsubstance withdrawal. While there are some subtle differences in symptoms, particularly psychological,\\nphysical, and behavioral symptoms, the general diagnostic criteria for substance use disorder,\\nsubstance intoxication, and substance withdrawal remains the same across substances. These\\ncriteria are reviewed below, with more specific details of psychological, physical, and behavioral\\nsymptoms in the Section 11.1.5.: Types of Substances Abused.'),\n",

Substance Use Disorder\\nThe essential feature of substance use disorder, is a “…cluster of cognitive, behavioral, and\\nphysiological symptoms indicating that the individual continues using the substance despite significant\\nsubstance-related problems” (APA, 2022, pg. 544) and can be diagnosed for all ten substance classes\\nexcept for caffeine. Distress or impairment can be described as any of the following: inability to\\ncomplete or lack of participation in work, school or home activities; increased time spent on activities\\nobtaining, using, or recovering from substance use; impairment in social or interpersonal relationships;\\nuse of a substance in a potentially hazardous situation; psychological problems due to recurrent\\nsubstance abuse; craving the substance; an increase in the amount of substance used over time (i.e.,\\ntolerance); difficulty reducing the amount of substance used despite a desire to reduce/stop using;\\nand/or withdrawal symptoms (APA, 2022). While the number of these symptoms may vary among\\nindividuals, only two symptoms are required for a diagnosis of substance use disorder.\\n \\n11.1.3. Substance Intoxication\\nFor a diagnosis of substance intoxication, the individual must have recently ingested a substanc.\\nImmediately following the ingestion of this substance, significant behavioral and/or psychological\\nchange is observed. In addition, physical and physiological symptoms present as a direct result of the\\nsubstance ingested. As stated above, these behavioral, physical, and physiological symptoms are\\ndependent on the type of substance that is ingested and, therefore, discussed in more detail within each\\nsubstance category (i.e., depressants, stimulants, hallucinogens/cannabis/combination). This said, the\\nmost common changes involve disturbances of perception, wakefulness, attention, thinking,\\npsychomotor behavior, interpersonal behavior, and judgment (APA, 2022).\\n \\n11.1.4. Substance Withdrawal\\nFinally, substance withdrawal is diagnosed when there is cessation or reduction of a substance that\\nhas been used for a long period of time. Individuals undergoing substance withdrawal will experience\\nphysiological and psychological symptoms within a few hours after cessation/reduction. These\\nsymptoms cause significant distress or impairment in daily functioning (APA, 2022). As with substance\\nintoxication, physiological and psychological symptoms during substance withdrawal are often specific\\nto the substance abused and are discussed in more detail within each substance category later in the\\nmodule.\\n \\n11.1.5. Types of Substances Abused\\nFor our purposes, the most abused substances will be divided into three categories based on how they\\nimpact one’s physiological state: depressants, stimulants, and hallucinogens/cannabis/combination.\\n     11.1.5.1.

Unfortunately, when used in large amounts, they can also impair an\\nindividual’s judgment and motor activity.\\nWhile alcohol is one of the only legal (over-the-counter) substances we will discuss, it is also the most\\ncommonly consumed substance. According to the 2015 National Survey on Drug Use and Health,\\napproximately 70% of individuals drank an alcoholic beverage in the last year, and nearly 56% of\\nindividuals drank an alcoholic beverage in the past month (SAMHSA, 2015). While the legal age of\\nconsumption in the United States is 21, approximately 78% of teens report that they drank alcohol at\\nsome point in their life (SAMHSA, 2013).\\nDespite the legal age of consumption, many college-aged students engage in binge or heavy drinking. In\\nfact, 45% of college-aged students report engaging in binge drinking, with 14% binge drinking at least\\n5 days per month (SAMHSA, 2013). In addition to these high levels of alcohol consumption, students\\nalso engage in other behaviors such as skipping meals, which can impact the rate of alcohol intoxication\\nand place them at risk for dehydration, blacking out, and developing alcohol-induced seizures (Piazza-\\nGardner & Barry, 2013).\\nThe “active” substance of alcohol, ethyl alcohol, is a chemical that is absorbed quickly into the blood via\\nthe lining of the stomach and intestine. Once in the bloodstream, ethyl alcohol travels to the central\\nnervous system (i.e., brain and spinal cord) and produces depressive symptoms such as impaired\\nreaction time, disorientation, and slurred speech. These symptoms are produced due to the ethyl\\nalcohol binding to GABA receptors, thus preventing GABA from providing inhibitory messages and\\nallowing the individual to relax (Filip et al., 2015).\\nThe effect of ethyl alcohol in moderation allows for an individual to relax, engage more readily in\\nconversation, and in general, produce a confident and happy personality. However, when consumption\\nis increased or excessive, the central nervous system is unable to metabolize the ethyl alcohol\\nadequately, and adverse effects begin to present. Symptoms such as blurred vision, difficulty walking,\\nslurred speech, slowed reaction time, and sometimes, aggressive behaviors are observed.\\nThe extent to which these symptoms present are directly related to the concentration of ethyl alcohol\\nwithin the body, as well as the individual’s ability to metabolize the ethyl alcohol. There are a lot of\\nfactors that contribute to how quickly one’s body can metabolize ethyl alcohol. Food, gender, body\\nweight, and medications are among the most common factors that affect alcohol absorption\\n(NIAAA,1997). More specifically, recent consumption of food, particularly those high in fat and\\ncarbohydrates, slow the absorption rate of ethyl alcohol, thus reducing its effects. Regarding gender,\\nwomen absorb and metabolize alcohol differently than men, likely due to the smaller amount of body\\nwater and the lower activity of an alcohol metabolizing enzyme in the stomach. Another factor related\\nto gender is weight—with individuals with more body mass metabolizing the alcohol at a slower rate\\nthan those who weigh less. Finally, various medications, both over the counter and prescription, can\\nimpact the liver’s ability to metabolize alcohol, thus affecting the severity of symptoms that present\\n(NIAAA, 1997).\\nSedative-Hypnotic drugs, more commonly known as anxiolytic drugs, have a calming and relaxing\\neffect on individuals. When used at a clinically appropriate dosage, they can have a sedative effect, thus\\nmaking them a suitable drug for treating anxiety-related disorders. In the early 1900s, barbiturates\\nwere introduced as the main sedative and hypnotic drug; however, due to their addictive nature, as well'),\n",

This increase in\\nGABA produces a sedative and calming effect. Benzodiazepines can be prescribed for both temporary\\nrelief (pre-flight or before surgery) or long-term use (generalized anxiety disorder). While they do not\\nproduce respiratory distress in large dosages like barbiturates, they can cause intoxication and\\naddictive behaviors due to their effects on tolerance.\\nOpioids are naturally occurring, derived from the sap of the opium poppy. In the early 1800s,\\nmorphine was isolated from opium by German chemist Friedrich Wilhelm Adam Serturner. Due to its\\nanalgesic effect, it was named after the Greek god of dreams, Morpheus (Brownstein, 1993). Its\\npopularity grew during the American Civil War as it was the primary medication given to soldiers with\\nbattle injuries. Unfortunately, this is also when the addictive nature of the medication was discovered,\\nas many soldiers developed “Soldier’s Disease” as a response to tolerance of the drug (Casey, 1978).\\nIn an effort to alleviate the addictive nature of morphine, heroin was synthesized by the German\\nchemical company Bayer in 1898 and was offered in a cough suppressant (Yes, Bayer promoted heroin).\\nFor years, heroin remained in cough suppressants as well as other pain reducers until it was discovered\\nthat heroin was more addictive than morphine. In 1917, Congress stated that all drugs derived from\\nopium were addictive, thus banning the use of opioids in over-the-counter medications.\\nOpioids are unique in that they provide both euphoria and drowsiness. Tolerance to these drugs builds\\nquickly, thus resulting in an increased need of the medication to produce desired effects. This rapid\\ntolerance is also likely responsible for opioids’ highly addictive nature. Opioid withdrawal symptoms can\\nrange from restlessness, muscle pain, fatigue, anxiety, and insomnia. Unfortunately, these withdrawal\\nsymptoms, as well as intense cravings for the drug, can persist for several months, with some reports\\nup to years. Because of the intensity and longevity of these withdrawal symptoms, many individuals\\nstruggle to remain abstinent, and accidental overdoses are common (CDC, 2013).\\nThe rise of abuse and misuse of opioid products in the early-to-mid 2000s is a direct result of the\\nincreased number of opioid prescription medications containing oxycodone and hydrocodone (Jayawant\\n& Balkrishnana, 2005). The 2015 report estimated 12.5 million Americans had abused prescription\\nnarcotic pain relievers in the past year (SAMHSA, 2016). In an effort to reduce such abuse, the FDA\\ndeveloped programs to educate prescribers about the risks of misuse and abuse of opioid medications.\\n     11.1.5.2. Stimulants. The two most common types of stimulants abused are cocaine and\\namphetamines. Unlike depressants that reduce the activity of the central nervous system, stimulants\\nhave the opposite effect, increasing the activity in the central nervous system. Physiological changes\\nthat occur with stimulants are increased blood pressure, heart rate, pressured thinking/speaking, and\\nrapid, often jerky behaviors. Because of these symptoms, stimulants are commonly used for their\\nfeelings of euphoria, to reduce appetite, and prevent sleep.\\nSimilar to opioids, cocaine is extracted from a South American plant—the coca plant—and produces\\nfeelings of energy and euphoria. It is the most potent natural stimulant known to date (Acosta et al.,\\n2011). Low doses can produce feelings of excitement, talkativeness, and euphoria; however, as the\\namount of ingested cocaine increases, physiological changes such as rapid breathing, increased blood'),\n",

The psychological and physiological effects of cocaine\\nare due to an increase of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin in various brain structures (Hart &\\nKsir, 2014; Haile, 2012).\\nOne key feature of cocaine use is the rapid high of cocaine intoxication, followed by the quick depletion,\\nor crashing, as the drug diminishes within the body. During the euphoric intoxication, individuals will\\nexperience poor muscle coordination, grandiosity, compulsive behavior, aggression, and possible\\nhallucinations and delusions (Haile, 2012). Conversely, as the drug leaves the system, the individual will\\nexperience adverse effects such as headaches, dizziness, and fainting (Acosta et al., 2011). These\\nnegative feelings often produce a negative feedback loop, encouraging individuals to ingest more\\ncocaine to alleviate the negative symptoms. This also increases the chance of accidental overdose.\\nCocaine is unique in that it can be ingested in various ways. While cocaine was initially snorted via the\\nnasal cavity, individuals found that if the drug was smoked or injected, its effects were more potent and\\nlonger-lasting (Haile, 2012). The most common way cocaine is currently ingested is via freebasing,\\nwhich involves heating cocaine with ammonia to extract the cocaine base. This method produces a form\\nof cocaine that is almost 100% pure. Due to its low melting point, freebased cocaine is easy to smoke via\\na glass pipe. Inhaled cocaine is absorbed into the bloodstream and brain within 10-15 seconds\\nsuggesting its effects are felt almost immediately (Addiction Centers of America).\\nCrack is a derivative of cocaine that is formed by combining cocaine with water and another substance\\n(commonly baking soda) to create a solid structure that is then broken into smaller pieces. Because of\\nthis process, it requires very little cocaine to make crack, thus making it a more affordable drug. Coined\\nfor the crackling sound that is produced when it is smoked, it is also highly addictive, likely due to the\\nfast-acting nature of the drug. While the effects of cocaine peak in 20-30 minutes and last for about 1-2\\nhours, the effects of crack peak in 3-5 minutes and last only for up to 60 minutes (Addiction Centers of\\nAmerica).\\nAmphetamines are manufactured in a laboratory setting. Currently, the most common amphetamines\\nare prescription medications such as Ritalin, Adderall, and Dexedrine (prescribed for sleep disorders).\\nThese medications produce an increase in energy and alertness and reduce appetite when taken at\\nclinical levels. However, when consumed at larger dosages, they can produce intoxication similar to\\npsychosis, including violent behaviors. Due to the increased energy levels and appetite suppressant\\nqualities, these medications are often abused by students studying for exams, athletes needing extra\\nenergy, and individuals seeking weight loss (Haile, 2012). Biologically, similar to cocaine,\\namphetamines affect the central nervous system by increasing the amount of dopamine,\\nnorepinephrine, and serotonin in the brain (Haile, 2012).\\nMethamphetamine, a derivative of amphetamine, is often abused due to its low cost and feelings of\\neuphoria and confidence; however, it can have serious health consequences such as heart and lung\\ndamage (Hauer, 2010). Most commonly used intravenously or nasally, methamphetamine can also be\\neaten or heated to a temperature in which it can be smoked. The most notable effects of\\nmethamphetamine use are the drastic physical changes to one’s appearance, including significant teeth\\ndamage and facial lesions (Rusyniak, 2011).\\nWhile we are sure you are well aware of how caffeine is consumed, you may be surprised to learn that\\nin addition to coffee, energy drinks, and soft drinks, caffeine can also be found in chocolate and tea.\\nBecause of the vast use of caffeine, it is the most widely consumed substance in the world, with'),\n",

While caffeine is often consumed in moderate dosages, caffeine intoxication and\\nwithdrawal can occur. In fact, an increase in caffeine intoxication and withdrawal have been observed\\nwith the simultaneous popularity of energy drinks. Common energy drinks such as Monster and RedBull\\nhave nearly double the amount of caffeine of tea and coke (Bigard, 2010). While adults commonly\\nconsume these drinks, a startling 30% of middle and high schoolers also report regular consumption of\\nenergy drinks to assist with academic and athletic responsibilities (Terry-McElrath, O’Malley, &\\nJohnston, 2014). The rapid increase in caffeinated beverages has led to a rise in ER visits due to the\\nintoxication effects (SAMHSA, 2013).\\n     11.1.5.3. Hallucinogens/Cannabis/Combination. The final category includes both hallucinogens\\nand cannabis- both of which produce sensory changes after ingestion. While hallucinogens are known\\nfor their ability to produce more severe delusions and hallucinations, cannabis also has the capability of\\nproducing delusions or hallucinations; however, this typically occurs only when large amounts of\\ncannabis are ingested. More commonly, cannabis has been known to have stimulant and depressive\\neffects, thus classifying itself in a group of its own due to the many different effects of the substance.\\nHallucinogens come from natural sources and have been involved in cultural and religious ceremonies\\nfor thousands of years. Synthetic forms of hallucinogens have also been created—most common of\\nwhich are PCP, Ketamine, LSD, and Ecstasy. In general, hallucinogens produce powerful changes in\\nsensory perception. Depending on the type of drug ingested, effects can range from hallucinations,\\nchanges in color perception, or distortion of objects. Additionally, some individuals report enhanced\\nauditory, as well as changes in physical perception such as tingling or numbness of limbs and\\ninterchanging hot and cold sensations (Weaver & Schnoll, 2008). Interestingly, the effect of\\nhallucinogens can vary both between individuals, as well as within the same individual. This means that\\nthe same amount of the same drug may produce a positive experience one time, but a negative\\nexperience the next time.\\nOverall, hallucinogens do not have addictive qualities; however, individuals can build a tolerance, thus\\nneeding larger quantities to produce similar effects (Wu, Ringwalt, Weiss, & Blazer, 2009).\\nFurthermore, there is some evidence that long-term use of these drugs results in psychosis, mood, or\\nanxiety disorders due to the neurobiological changes after using hallucinogens (Weaver & Schnoll,\\n2008).\\nSimilar to hallucinogens and a few other substances, cannabis is also derived from a natural plant—the\\nhemp plant. While the most powerful of hemp plants is hashish, the most commonly known type of\\ncannabis, marijuana, is a mixture of hemp leaves, buds, and the tops of plants (SAMHSA, 2014). Many\\nexternal factors impact the potency of cannabis, such as the climate it was grown in, the method of\\npreparation, and the duration of storage. Of the active chemicals within cannabis,\\ntetrahydrocannabinol (THC) appears to be the single component that determines the potent nature\\nof the drug. Various strains of marijuana have varying amounts of THC; hashish contains a high\\nconcentration of THC, while marijuana has a small concentration.\\nTHC binds to cannabinoid receptors in the brain, which produces psychoactive effects. These effects\\nvary depending on both an individual’s body chemistry, as well as various strains and concentrations of\\nTHC.

This combination of substance use can have dangerous results\\ndepending on the interactions between substances. For example, if multiple depressant drugs (i.e.,\\nalcohol, benzodiazepines, and/or opiates) are consumed at one time, an individual is at risk for severe\\nrespiratory distress or even death due to the compounding depressive effects on the central nervous\\nsystem. Additionally, when an individual is under the influence of one substance, judgment may be\\nimpaired, and ingestion of a larger amount of another drug may lead to an accidental overdose.

Biological\\n     11.4.1.1. Genetics. Similar to other mental health disorders, substance abuse is genetically\\ninfluenced.  With that said, it is different than other mental health disorders in that if the individual is\\nnot exposed to the substance, they will not develop substance abuse.\\nHeritability of alcohol abuse is among the most well studied substances, likely because it is the only\\nlegal substance (except cannabis in some states). Twin studies have indicated a range of 50-60%\\nheritability risk for alcohol disorder (Kendler et al., 1997). Studies exploring the heritability of other\\nsubstance abuse, particularly drug use, suggests there may be a stronger heritability link than\\npreviously thought (Jang, Livesley, & Vernon, 1995). Twin studies indicate that the genetic component\\nof drug abuse is stronger than drug use in general, meaning that genetic factors are more significant\\nfor abuse of a substance over nonproblematic use (Tsuang et al., 1996). Merikangas and colleagues\\n(1998) found an 8-fold increased risk for developing a substance abuse disorder across a wide range of\\nsubstances.\\nUnique to substance abuse is the fact that both genetic and familial influence are both at play. What\\ndoes this mean? Well, biologically, the individual may be genetically predisposed to substance abuse;\\nadditionally, the individual may also be at risk due to their familial environment where their parents or\\nsiblings are also engaging in substance abuse. Individuals whose parents abuse substances may have a\\ngreater opportunity to ingest substances, thus promoting drug-seeking behaviors. Furthermore, families\\nwith a history of substance abuse may have a more accepting attitude of drug use than families with no\\nhistory of substance abuse (Leventhal & Schmitz, 2006).\\n     11.4.1.2. Neurobiological. A longstanding belief about how drug abuse begins and is maintained\\nis the brain reward system. A reward can be defined as any event that increases the likelihood of a\\nresponse and has a pleasurable effect. Most of the research on the brain reward system has focused on\\nthe mesocorticolimbic dopamine system, as it appears this area is the primary reward system of most\\nsubstances that are abused. As research has evolved in the field of substance abuse, five additional\\nneurotransmitters have also been implicated in the reinforcing effect of addiction: dopamine, opioid\\npeptides, GABA, serotonin, and endocannabinoids. More specifically, dopamine is less involved in\\nopioid, alcohol, and cannabis. Alcohol and benzodiazepines lower the production of GABA, while cocaine\\nand amphetamines decrease dopamine. Cannabis has been shown to reduce the production of\\nendocannabinoids.\\n \\n11.4.2.

The expectancy effect can be defined in both positive\\nand negative forms. Positive expectations are thought to increase drug-seeking behavior, while negative\\nexperiences would decrease substance use (Oei & Morawska, 2004). Several studies have examined the\\nexpectancy effect on the use of alcohol. Those with alcohol abuse reported expectations of tension\\nreduction, enhanced sexual experiences, and improved social pleasure (Brown, 1985). Additionally,\\nobserving positive experiences, both in person and through television or social media, also shapes our\\ndrug use expectancies.\\nWhile some studies have explored the impact of negative expectancy to eliminate substance abuse,\\nresearch has failed to continually support this theory, suggesting that positive experiences and\\nexpectations are a more powerful motivator of substance abuse than the negative experiences (Jones,\\nCorbin, Fromme, 2001).\\n \\n11.4.3. Behavioral\\nOperant conditioning has been implicated in the role of developing substance use disorders. As you may\\nremember, operant conditioning refers to the increase or decrease of a behavior, due to reinforcement\\nor punishment. Since we are talking about increasing substance use, behavioral theorists suggest that\\nsubstance abuse is positively and negatively reinforced due to the effects of a substance.\\nPositive reinforcement occurs when substance use is increased due to the positive or pleasurable\\nexperiences of the substance. More specifically, the rewarding effect or pleasurable experiences while\\nunder the influence of various substances directly impacts the likelihood that the individual will use the\\nsubstance again. Studies of substance use on animals routinely support this theory as animals will work\\nto receive injections of various drugs (Wise & Koob, 2013).\\nNegative reinforcement, or the increase of a given behavior due to the removal of a negative effect, also\\nplays a role in substance abuse in two different ways. First, many people ingest a substance as an\\nescape from their unpleasant life—whether it be physical pain, stress, or anxiety, to name a few.\\nTherefore, the substance temporarily provides relief from a negative environment, thus reinforcing\\nfuture substance abuse (Wise & Koob, 2013). Secondly, negative reinforcement is involved in symptoms\\nof withdrawal. As previously mentioned, withdrawal from a substance often produces significant\\nnegative symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, uncontrollable shaking, etc. To eliminate these symptoms,\\nan individual will consume more of the substance, thus again escaping the negative symptoms and\\nenjoying the “highs” of the substance.    \\n \\n11.4.4. Sociocultural\\nArguably, one of the strongest influences of substance abuse is the impact of one’s friends and the\\nimmediate environment. Peer attitudes, perception of others’ drug use, pressure from peers to use\\nsubstances, and beliefs about substance use are among the strongest predictors of drug use patterns\\n(Leventhal & Schmitz, 2006). This is particularly concerning during adolescence when patterns of\\nsubstance use typically begin.'),\n",

The increased possibility of family members’ substance abuse is likely\\nrelated to both a genetic predisposition, as well as the accepting attitude of the familial environment\\n(Chung et al., 2014). Not only does a child have early exposure to these substances if their parent has a\\nsubstance abuse problem, but they are also less likely to have parental supervision, which may impact\\ntheir decision related to substance use (Wagner et al., 2010). One potential protective factor against\\nsubstance use is religiosity. More specifically, families that promote religiosity may reduce substance\\nuse by promoting negative experiences (Galen & Rogers, 2004).\\nAnother sociocultural view on substance abuse is stressful life events, particularly those related to\\nfinancial stability. Prevalence rates of substance abuse are higher among poorer people (SAMHSA,\\n2014). Furthermore, additional stressors such as childhood abuse and trauma, negative work\\nenvironments, as well as discrimination are also believed to contribute to the development of a\\nsubstance use disorder (Hurd, Varner, Caldwell, & Zimmerman, 2014; McCabe, Wilsnack, West, &\\nBoyd, 2010; Unger et al., 2014).\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nBiological causes of substance-related and addictive disorders include the brain reward system\\nand a genetic predisposition, though if the individual is not exposed to the substance they will not\\ndevelop the substance abuse.\\nCognitive causes of substance-related and addictive disorders include the expectancy effect, and\\nresearch provides stronger support for positive expectancy over negative expectancy.\\nBehavioral causes of substance-related and addictive disorders include positive and negative\\nreinforcement.\\nSociocultural causes of substance-related and addictive disorders include friends and the\\nimmediate environment.\\n \\nSection 11.4 Review Questions\\nDiscuss the brain reward system.

Overall, treatments for substance-related\\ndisorders are only mildly effective, likely due in large part to the addictive qualities in many of these\\nsubstances (Belendiuk & Riggs, 2014).\\n \\n11.5.1. Biological\\n     11.5.1.1. Detoxification. Detoxification refers to the medical supervision of withdrawal from a\\nspecified drug. While most detoxification programs are inpatient for increased monitoring, some\\nprograms allow for outpatient detoxification, particularly if the addiction is not as severe. There are two\\nmain theories of detoxification—gradually decreasing the amount of the substance until the individual is\\noff the drug completely, or eliminating the substance entirely while providing additional medications to\\nmanage withdrawal symptoms (Bisaga et al., 2015). Unfortunately, relapse rates are high for those\\nengaging in detoxification programs, particularly if they lack any follow-up psychological treatment.\\n     11.5.1.2. Agonist drugs. As researchers continue to learn more about both the mechanisms of\\nsubstances commonly abused, as well as the mechanisms in which the body processes these substances,\\nalternative medications are created to essentially replace the drug in which the individual is dependent\\non. These agonist drugs provide the individual with a “safe” drug that has a similar chemical make-up\\nto the addicted drug. One common example of this is methadone, an opiate agonist that is often used in\\nthe reduction of heroin use (Schwartz, Brooner, Montoya, Currens, & Hayes, 2010). Unfortunately,\\nbecause methadone reacts to the same neurotransmitter receptors as heroin, the individual essentially\\nreplaces their addiction to heroin with an addiction to methadone. While this is not ideal, methadone\\ntreatment is highly regulated under safe medical supervision. Furthermore, it is taken by mouth, thus\\neliminating the potential adverse effects of unsterilized needles in heroin use. While some argue that\\nmethadone maintenance programs are not an effective treatment because it simply replaces one drug\\nfor another, others claim that the combination of methadone with education and psychotherapy can\\nsuccessfully help individuals off both illicit drugs and methadone medications (Jhanjee, 2014).\\n     11.5.1.3. Antagonist drugs. Unlike agonist drugs, antagonist drugs block or change the effects\\nof the addictive drug. The most commonly prescribed antagonist drugs are Disulfiram and Naloxone.\\nDisulfiram is often given to individuals trying to abstain from alcohol as it produces significant negative\\neffects (i.e., nausea, vomiting, increased heart rate, and dizziness) when coupled with alcohol\\nconsumption. While this can be an effective treatment to eliminate alcohol use, the individual must be'),\n",

Naloxone acts by binding to\\nendorphin receptors, thus preventing the opioids from having the intended euphoric effect. In theory,\\nthis treatment appears promising, but it is extremely dangerous as it can send the individual into\\nimmediate, severe withdrawal symptoms (Alter, 2014). This type of treatment requires appropriate\\nmedical supervision to ensure the safety of the patient.\\n \\n11.5.2. Behavioral\\n     11.5.2.1. Aversion therapy. Based on respondent conditioning principles, aversion therapy is a\\nform of treatment for substance abuse that pairs the stimulus with some type of negative or aversive\\nstimulus. For example, an individual may be given a shock every time they think about or attempt to\\ndrink alcohol. By pairing this aversive stimulus to the abused substance, the individual will begin to\\nindependently pair the substance with an aversive thought, thus reducing their craving/desire for the\\nsubstance. Some view the use of agonist and antagonist drugs as a form of aversion therapy as these\\nmedications utilize the same treatment strategy as traditional aversion therapy.\\n     11.5.2.2. Contingency management. Contingency management is a treatment approach that\\nemphasizes operant conditioning—increasing sobriety and adherence to treatment programs through\\nrewards. Originally developed to increase adherence to medication and reinforce opiate abstinence in\\nmethadone patients, contingency management has been adapted to increase abstinence in many\\ndifferent substance abuse treatment programs. In general, patients are “rewarded” with vouchers or\\nprizes in exchange for abstinence from substance use (Hartzler, Lash, & Roll, 2012).  These vouchers\\nallow individuals to gain incentives specific to their interests, thus increasing the chances of abstinence.\\nCommon vouchers include movie tickets, sports equipment, or even cash (Mignon, 2014).\\nContingency management has been proven to be effective in treating various types of substance abuse,\\nparticularly alcohol and cocaine (Lewis & Petry, 2005). Not only has it been effective in reducing\\nsubstance use in addicts, but it has also been effective in increasing the amount of time patients remain\\nin treatment as well as compliance with the treatment program (Mignon, 2014). Despite its success,\\ndissemination of this type of treatment has been rare. To rectify this, the federal government has\\nprovided financial resources through SAMHSA for the development, implementation, and evaluation of\\ncontingency management as a treatment to reduce alcohol and drug use (Mignon, 2014).\\n \\n11.5.3. Cognitive-Behavioral\\n     11.5.3.1. Relapse prevention training. Relapse prevention training is essentially what it sounds\\nlike—identifying potentially high-risk situations for relapse and then learning behavioral skills and\\ncognitive interventions to prevent the occurrence of a relapse. Early in treatment, the clinician guides\\nthe patient to identify any interpersonal, intrapersonal, environmental, and physiological risks for\\nrelapse. Once these triggers are identified, the clinician works with the patient on cognitive and\\nbehavioral strategies such as learning effective coping strategies, enhancing self-efficacy, and\\nencouraging mastery of outcomes. Additionally, psychoeducation about how substance abuse is\\nmaintained, as well as identifying maladaptive thoughts and learning cognitive restructuring'),\n",

Finally, role-playing\\nthese high-risk situations in session allows patients to become comfortable engaging in these effective\\ncoping strategies that enhance their self-efficacy and ultimately reducing the chances of a relapse.\\nResearch for relapse prevention training appears to be somewhat effective for individuals with\\nsubstance-related disorders (Marlatt & Donovan, 2005).  \\n \\n11.5.4. Sociocultural\\n     11.5.4.1. Self-help. In 1935, two men suffering from alcohol abuse met and discussed their\\ntreatment options. Slowly, the group grew, and by 1946, this group was known as Alcoholics\\nAnonymous (AA). The two founders, along with other early members, developed the Twelve Step\\nTraditions to help guide members in spiritual and character development. Due to the popularity of the\\ntreatment program, other programs such as Narcotics Anonymous and Cocaine Anonymous, adopted\\nand adapted the Twelve Steps for their respective substance abuse. Similarly, Al-Anon and Alateen are\\ntwo support groups that offer support for families and teenagers of individuals struggling with alcohol\\nabuse.\\nThe overarching goal of AA is abstinence from alcohol. To achieve this, the participants are encouraged\\nto “take one day at a time.” In using the 12 steps, participants are emboldened to admit that they have a\\ndisease, that they are powerless over this disease, and that their disease is more powerful than any\\nperson. Therefore, participants turn their addiction over to God and ask for help to right their wrongs\\nand remove their negative character defects and shortcomings. The final steps include identifying and\\nmaking amends to those who they have wronged during their alcohol abuse.\\nWhile studies examining the effectiveness of AA programs are inconclusive, AA’s membership indicates\\nthat 27% of its members have been sober less than one year, 24% have been sober 1-5 years, 13% have\\nbeen sober 5-10 years, 14% have been sober 10-20 years, and more than 22% have been sober over 20\\nyears (Alcoholics Anonymous, 2014).  Some argue that this type of treatment is most effective for those\\nwho are willing and able to abstain from alcohol as opposed to those who can control their drinking to\\nmoderate levels.\\n     11.5.4.2. Residential treatment centers. Another type of treatment similar to self-help is\\nresidential treatment programs. In this placement, individuals are completely removed from their\\nenvironment and live, work, and socialize within a drug-free community while also attending regular\\nindividual, group, and family therapy. The types of treatment used within a residential program varies\\nfrom program to program, with most focusing on cognitive-behavioral and behavioral techniques.\\nSeveral also incorporate 12-step programs into treatment, as many patients transition from a residential\\ntreatment center to a 12-step program post discharge. As one would expect, the residential treatment\\ngoal is abstinence, and any evidence of substance abuse during the program is grounds for immediate\\ntermination.\\nStudies examining the effectiveness of residential treatment centers suggest that these programs are\\nuseful in treating a variety of substance abuse disorders; however, many of these programs are very\\ncostly, thus limiting the availability of this treatment to the general public (Bender, 2004; Galanter,\\n2014). Additionally, many individuals are not able to completely remove themselves from their daily\\nresponsibilities for several weeks to months, particularly those with families. Therefore, while this\\ntreatment option is very effective, it is also not an option for most individuals struggling with substance'),\n",

The Clinical Presentation of Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders\\nThe schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders are defined by one of the following main\\nsymptoms: delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking (speech), disorganized or abnormal motor\\nbehavior, and negative symptoms. Individuals diagnosed with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder\\nexperience psychosis, which is defined as a loss of contact with reality. Psychosis episodes make it\\ndifficult for individuals to perceive and respond to environmental stimuli, causing a significant\\ndisturbance in everyday functioning. While there are a vast number of symptoms displayed in\\nschizophrenia spectrum disorders, presentation of symptoms varies greatly among individuals, as there\\nare rarely two cases similar in presentation, triggers, course, or responsiveness to treatment.\\n     12.1.1.1. Delusions. Delusions are “fixed beliefs that are not amenable to change in light of\\nconflicting evidence” (APA, 2022, pp. 101). This means that despite evidence contradicting one’s\\nthoughts, the individual is unable to distinguish their thoughts from reality. The inability to identify\\nthoughts as delusional is likely likely due to a lack of insight. There are a wide range of  delusions that\\nare seen in the schizophrenia related disorders to include:\\nDelusions of grandeur– belief they have exceptional abilities, wealth, or fame; belief they are\\nGod or other religious saviors\\nDelusions of control– belief that others control their thoughts/feelings/actions\\nDelusions of thought broadcasting– belief that one’s thoughts are transparent and everyone\\nknows what they are thinking\\nDelusions of persecution– belief they are going to be harmed, harassed, plotted or\\ndiscriminated against by either an individual or an institution; it is the most common delusion\\n(Arango & Carpenter, 2010)\\nDelusions of reference– belief that specific gestures, comments, or even larger environmental\\ncues are directed directly to them\\nDelusions of thought withdrawal– belief that one’s thoughts have been removed by another\\nsource\\nIt is believed that the presentation of the delusion is primarily related to the social, emotional,\\neducational, and cultural background of the individual (Arango & Carpenter, 2010). For example, an\\nindividual with schizophrenia who comes from a highly religious family is more likely to experience\\nreligious delusions (delusions of grandeur) than another type of delusion.\\n     12.1.1.2. Hallucinations. Hallucinations are “perception-like experiences that occur without an\\nexternal stimulus” (APA, 2022, pg. 102). They can occur in any of the five senses: hearing (auditory\\nhallucinations), seeing (visual hallucinations), smelling (olfactory hallucinations), touching (tactile\\nhallucinations), and tasting (gustatory hallucinations). Additionally, they can occur in a single modality\\nor present across a combination of modalities (e.g., having auditory and visual hallucinations). For the\\nmost part, individuals recognize that their hallucinations are not real and attempt to engage in normal\\nbehavior while simultaneously combating ongoing hallucinations.'),\n",

Among the most common types of auditory hallucinations are voices talking to the\\npatient or various voices talking to one another. Generally, these hallucinations are not attributable to\\nany one person that the individual knows. They are usually clear, objective, and definite (Arango &\\nCarpenter, 2010). Additionally, the auditory hallucinations can be pleasurable, providing comfort to the\\npatient; however, in other individuals, the auditory hallucinations can be unsettling as they produce\\ncommands or malicious intent.\\n     12.1.1.3. Disorganized thinking (Speech). Among the most common cognitive impairments\\ndisplayed in patients with schizophrenia are disorganized thoughts, communication, and speech. More\\nspecifically, thoughts and speech patterns may appear to be circumstantial or tangential. For example,\\npatients may give unnecessary details in response to a question before they finally produce the desired\\nresponse. While the question is eventually answered in circumstantial speech patterns, in tangential\\nspeech patterns the patient never reaches the point. Another common cognitive symptom is speech\\nincoherence or word salad, where speech is “nearly incomprehensible and resembles receptive aphasia\\nin its linguistic disorganization” (APA, 2022, pg. 102). Derailment, or the illogical connection in a chain\\nof thoughts, is another common type of disorganized thinking. Although not always, derailment is often\\nseen in illogicality, or the tendency to provide bizarre explanations for things.\\nThese types of distorted thought patterns are often related to concrete thinking. That is, the individual\\nis focused on one aspect of a concept or thing and neglects all other aspects. This type of thinking\\nmakes treatment difficult as individuals lack insight into their illness and symptoms.\\n     12.1.1.4. Disorganized/abnormal motor behavior. These symptoms manifest as childlike\\n“silliness” to unpredictable agitation. Catatonic behavior, the decreased or complete lack of reactivity to\\nthe environment, is among the most commonly seen grossly disorganized motor behavior in\\nschizophrenia. There runs a range of catatonic behaviors from negativism (resistance to instruction);\\nmutism or stupor (complete lack of verbal and motor responses); rigidity (maintaining a rigid or upright\\nposture while resisting efforts to be moved); or posturing (holding odd, awkward postures for long\\nperiods). There is one type of catatonic behavior, catatonic excitement, where the individual\\nexperiences hyperactivity of motor behavior, in a seemingly excited or delirious way. Other features\\ninclude repeated stereotyped movements, staring, grimacing, and the echoing of speech (APA, 2022, pg.\\n102).\\n     12.1.1.5. Negative symptoms. Up until this point, all the symptoms can be categorized as positive\\nsymptoms, or symptoms that are an over-exaggeration of normal brain processes; these symptoms are\\nalso new to the individual. The final diagnostic criterion is negative symptoms, which are defined as\\nthe inability or decreased ability to initiate actions, speech, express emotion, or feel pleasure (Barch,\\n2013). Negative symptoms often present before positive symptoms and remain once positive symptoms\\nremit. Because of their prevalence through the course of the disorder, they are also more indicative of\\nprognosis, with more negative symptoms suggesting a poorer prognosis. The poorer prognosis may be\\nexplained by the lack of effectiveness antipsychotic medications have in addressing negative symptoms\\n(Kirkpatrick, Fenton, Carpenter, & Marder, 2006). There are six main types of negative symptoms seen\\nin patients with schizophrenia. Such symptoms include:\\nDiminished emotional expression – Reduction in emotional expression; reduced display of\\nemotional expression'),\n",

Schizophrenia\\nAs stated above, the hallmark symptoms of schizophrenia include the presentation of at least two of\\nthe following during a one month period: delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech,\\ndisorganized/abnormal behavior, or negative symptoms. These symptoms create significant impairment\\nin an individual’s ability to engage in normal daily functioning such as work, school, relationships with\\nothers, or self-care, and continuous signs of the disturbance persist for at least 6 months. It should be\\nnoted that the presentation of schizophrenia varies significantly among individuals, as it is a\\nheterogeneous clinical syndrome (APA, 2022).\\nWhile the presence of symptoms must persist for a minimum of 6 months to meet the criteria for a\\nschizophrenia diagnosis, it is not uncommon to have prodromal symptoms that precede the active\\nphase of the disorder and residual symptoms that follow it. These prodromal and residual symptoms\\nare “subthreshold” forms of psychotic symptoms that do not cause significant impairment in\\nfunctioning, with the exception of negative symptoms (Lieberman et al., 2001). Due to the severity of\\npsychotic symptoms, mood disorder symptoms are also common among individuals with schizophrenia;\\nhowever, these mood symptoms are distinct from a mood disorder diagnosis in that psychotic features\\nwill exist beyond the remission of depressive symptoms.\\n \\n12.1.3. Schizophreniform Disorder\\nSchizophreniform disorder is similar to schizophrenia, except for the length of presentation of\\nsymptoms. Schizophreniform disorder is considered an “intermediate” disorder between schizophrenia\\nand brief psychotic disorder as the symptoms are present for at least one month but not longer than six\\nmonths. Schizophrenia symptoms must be present for at least six months and a brief psychotic disorder\\nis diagnosed when symptoms are present for less than one month. Approximately two-thirds of\\nindividuals who are initially diagnosed with schizophreniform disorder will have symptoms that last\\nlonger than six months, at which time their diagnosis is changed to schizophrenia (APA, 2022).\\nAnother key distinguishing feature of schizophreniform disorder is the lack of criteria related to\\nimpaired functioning. While many individuals with schizophreniform disorder do display impaired\\nfunctioning, it is not essential for diagnosis. Finally, any major mood episodes—either depressive or\\nmanic— that are present concurrently with the psychotic features must only be present for a short time,\\notherwise a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder may be more appropriate (APA, 2022).\\n \\nMaking Sense of the Disorders'),\n",

Schizoaffective Disorder\\nSchizoaffective disorder is characterized by the psychotic symptoms included in schizophrenia and a\\nconcurrent uninterrupted period of a major mood episode—either a major depressive or manic episode.\\nIt should be noted that because the loss of interest in pleasurable activities is a common symptom of\\nschizophrenia, to meet the criteria for a depressive episode within schizoaffective disorder, the\\nindividual must present with a pervasive depressed mood (APA, 2022). While schizophrenia and\\nschizophreniform disorder do not have a significant mood component, schizoaffective disorder requires\\nthe presence of a depressive or manic episode for the majority, if not the total duration of the disorder.\\nWhile psychotic symptoms are sometimes present in depressive episodes, they often remit once the\\ndepressive episode is resolved. For individuals with schizoaffective disorder, psychotic symptoms should\\ncontinue for at least two weeks in the absence of a major mood disorder (APA, 2022). This is the key\\ndistinguishing feature between schizoaffective disorder and major depressive disorder with psychotic\\nfeatures.\\n \\n12.1.5. Delusional Disorder\\nAs suggestive of its title, delusional disorder requires the presence of at least one delusion that lasts\\nfor at least one month in duration. It is important to note that if an individual experiences\\nhallucinations, disorganized speech, disorganized or catatonic behavior, or negative symptoms—in\\naddition to delusions—they should not be diagnosed with delusional disorder as their symptoms are\\nmore aligned with a schizophrenia diagnosis. Unlike most other schizophrenia-related disorders, daily\\nfunctioning is not overly impacted due to the delusions. Additionally, if symptoms of depressive or\\nmanic episodes present during delusions, they are typically brief compared to the duration of the\\ndelusions.\\nThe DSM-V-TR (APA, 2022) has identified five main subtypes of delusional disorder to better categorize\\nthe symptoms of the individual’s disorder. When making a diagnosis of delusional disorder, one of the\\nfollowing modifiers (in addition to mixed presentation) is included. Erotomanic delusion occurs when\\nan individual reports a delusion of another person being in love with them. Generally speaking, the\\nindividual whom the convictions are about is of higher status, such as a celebrity. Grandiose delusion\\ninvolves the conviction of having great talent or insight. Occasionally, patients will report they have\\nmade an important discovery that benefits the general public. Grandiose delusions may also take on\\nreligious affiliation, as people believe they are prophets or even God. Jealous delusion revolves around\\nthe conviction that one’s spouse or partner is/has been unfaithful. While many individuals may have this\\nsuspicion at some point in their relationship, a jealous delusion is much more extensive and generally\\nbased on incorrect inferences that lack evidence. Persecutory delusion involves the individual'),\n",

Of all subtypes of\\ndelusional disorder, those experiencing persecutory delusions are the most at risk of becoming\\naggressive or hostile, likely due to the persecutory nature of their distorted beliefs. Finally, somatic\\ndelusion involves delusions regarding bodily functions or sensations. While these delusions can vary\\nsignificantly, the most common beliefs are that the individual emits a foul odor despite attempts to\\nrectify the smell; there is an infestation of insects on the skin; or that they have an internal parasite\\n(APA, 2022). If no one delusion predominates, the mixed type specifier is used and if the dominant\\ndelusional belief cannot be clearly determined, use the unspecified type specifier.

This percentage drops\\nto 17% in fraternal twins.

Additional studies also\\nindicate a reduction in the orbitofrontal regions of the brain, a part of the frontal lobe that is\\nresponsible for response inhibition (Kurtz, 2015).\\n     12.4.1.3. Stress cascade. The stress-vulnerability model suggests that individuals have a genetic\\nor biological predisposition to develop the disorder; however, symptoms will not present unless there is\\na stressful precipitating factor that elicits the onset of the disorder. Researchers have identified the\\nHPA axis and its consequential neurological effects as the likely responsible neurobiological component\\nresponsible for this stress cascade.\\nThe HPA axis is one of the main neurobiological structures that mediate stress. It involves the\\nregulation of three chemical messengers (corticotropin-releasing hormone [CRH], adrenocorticotropic\\nhormone [ACTH], and glucocorticoids) as they respond to a stressful situation (Corcoran et al., 2003).\\nGlucocorticoids, more commonly referred to as cortisol, is the final neurotransmitter released which is\\nresponsible for the physiological change that accompanies stress to prepare the body to “fight” or\\n“flight.”\\nIt is hypothesized that in combination with abnormal brain structures, persistently increased levels of\\nglucocorticoids in brain structures may be the key to the onset of psychosis in prodromal patients\\n(Corcoran et al., 2003). More specifically, stress exposure (and increased glucocorticoids) affects the\\nneurotransmitter system and exacerbates psychotic symptoms due to changes in dopamine activity\\n(Walker & Diforio, 1997). While research continues to explore the relationship between stress and onset\\nof the disorder, evidence for the implication of stress and symptom relapse is strong. More specifically,\\nschizophrenia patients experience more stressful life events leading up to a relapse of symptoms.\\nSimilarly, it is hypothesized that the worsening or exacerbation of symptoms is also a source of stress as\\nthey interfere with daily functioning (Walker & Diforio, 1997). This stress alone may be enough to\\ninitiate the onset of a relapse.\\n \\n12.4.2. Psychological\\n     12.4.2.1. Cognitive. The cognitive model utilizes some of the aspects of the diathesis-stress model\\nin that it proposes that premorbid neurocognitive impairment places individuals at risk for aversive\\nwork/academic/interpersonal experiences. These experiences, in turn, lead to dysfunctional beliefs and\\ncognitive appraisals, ultimately leading to maladaptive behaviors such as delusions/hallucinations (Beck\\n& Rector, 2005). Beck proposed the following diathesis-stress model for how schizophrenia develops\\n(Fee Figure 12.1).\\n \\nFigure 12.1. Diathesis-Stress Model of the Development of Schizophrenia'),\n",

The combination of the aversive events\\nand negative interpretations produces a stress response in the individual, thus igniting hyperactivation\\nof the HPA axis.

Although more recent advancements\\nin treatment for schizophrenia appear promising, the disease itself is still viewed as one that requires\\nlifelong treatment and care.\\n \\n12.5.1. Psychopharmacological\\nAmong the first antipsychotic medications used for the treatment of schizophrenia was Thorazine.\\nDeveloped as a derivative of antihistamines, Thorazine was the first line of treatment that produced a\\ncalming effect on even the most severely agitated patients and allowed for the organization of thoughts.\\nDespite their effectiveness in managing psychotic symptoms, conventional antipsychotics (such as\\nThorazine and Chlorpromazine) also produced significant  side effects similar to that of neurological\\ndisorders. Therefore, psychotic symptoms were replaced with muscle tremors, involuntary movements,\\nand muscle rigidity. Additionally, these conventional antipsychotics also produced tardive dyskinesia\\nin patients, which included involuntary movements isolated to the tongue, mouth, and face (Tenback et\\nal., 2006). While only 10% of patients reported the development of tardive dyskinesia, this percentage\\nincreased the longer patients were on the medication, as well as the higher the dose (Achalia,\\nChaturvedi, Desai, Rao, & Prakash, 2014). In efforts to avoid these symptoms, clinicians have been\\ncognizant of not exceeding the clinically effective dose of conventional antipsychotic medications. If the\\nmanagement of psychotic symptoms cannot be resolved at this level, alternative medications are often\\nadded to produce a synergistic effect (Roh et al., 2014).\\nDue to the harsh side effects of conventional antipsychotic drugs, newer, arguably more effective\\nsecond-generation or atypical antipsychotic drugs have been developed. The atypical antipsychotic\\ndrugs appear to act on both dopamine and serotonin receptors, as opposed to only dopamine receptors\\nin the conventional antipsychotics. Because of this, common medications such as clozapine (Clozaril),\\nrisperidone (Risperdal), and aripiprazole (Abilify), appear to be more effective in managing both positive\\nand negative symptoms. While there continues to be a risk of developing side effects such as tardive\\ndyskinesia, recent studies suggest it is much lower than that of the conventional antipsychotics (Leucht,\\nHeres, Kissling, & Davis, 2011). Thus, due to their effectiveness and minimal side effects, atypical\\nantipsychotic medications are typically the first line of treatment for schizophrenia (Barnes & Marder,\\n2011).\\nIt should be noted that because of the harsh side effects of antipsychotic medications in general, many\\nindividuals, nearly one half to three-quarters of patients, discontinue the use of antipsychotic drugs\\n(Leucht, Heres, Kissling, & Davis, 2011). Because of this, it is also important to incorporate\\npsychological interventions along with psychopharmacological treatment to both address medication\\nadherence, as well as provide additional support for symptom management.\\n \\n12.5.2. Psychological Interventions\\n     12.5.2.1. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).

Therefore, the goal of CBT is not on\\nsymptom reduction, but rather to improve the interpretations and understandings of these symptoms\\n(and experiences) which will reduce associated distress (Kurtz, 2015). Common features of CBT for\\nschizophrenia patients include psychoeducation about their disease and the course of their symptoms\\n(i.e., ways to identify coming and going of delusions/hallucinations), challenging and replacing the\\nnegative thoughts/behaviors associated with their delusions/hallucinations to more positive\\nthoughts/behaviors, and finally, learning positive coping strategies to deal with their unpleasant\\nsymptoms (Veiga-Martinez, Perez-Alvarez, & Garcia-Montes, 2008).\\nFindings from studies exploring CBT as a supportive treatment have been promising. One study\\nconducted by Aaron Beck (the founder of CBT) and colleagues (Grant, Huh, Perivoliotis, Stolar, & Beck,\\n2011) found that recovery-oriented CBT produced a marked improvement in overall functioning as well\\nas symptom reduction in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. This study suggests that by focusing on\\ntargeted goals such as independent living, securing employment, and improving social relationships,\\npatients were able to slowly move closer to these targeted goals. By also including a variety of CBT\\nstrategies such as role-playing, scheduling community outings, and addressing negative cognitions,\\nindividuals were also able to address cognitive and social skill deficits.\\n \\n12.5.3. Family Interventions\\nThe diathesis-stress model of schizophrenia has primarily influenced family interventions. As previously\\ndiscussed, the emergence of the disorder and exacerbation of symptoms is likely related to\\nenvironmental stressors and psychological factors. While the degree in which environmental stress\\nstimulates an exacerbation of symptoms varies among individuals, there is significant evidence to\\nconclude that stress does impact illness presentation (Haddock & Spaulding, 2011). Therefore, the\\noverall goal of family interventions is to reduce the stress on the individual that is likely to elicit the\\nonset of symptoms.\\nUnlike many other psychological interventions, there is not a specific outline for family-based\\ninterventions related to schizophrenia. However, the majority of programs include the following\\ncomponents: psychoeducation, problem-solving skills, and cognitive-behavioral therapy.\\nPsychoeducation is important for both the patient and family members as it is reported that more than\\nhalf of those recovering from a psychotic episode reside with their family (Haddock & Spaulding, 2011).\\nTherefore, educating families on the course of the illness, as well as ways to recognize onset of\\npsychotic symptoms, is important to ensure optimal recovery.\\nProblem-solving is a crucial component in the family intervention model. Seeing as family conflict can\\nincrease stress within the home, which in return can lead to worsening of psychotic symptoms, family\\nmembers benefit from learning effective methods of problem-solving to address family conflicts.\\nAdditionally, teaching positive coping strategies for dealing with the symptoms of mental illness and its\\ndirect effect on the family environment may also alleviate some friction within the home\\nThe third component, CBT, is similar to that described above. The goal of family-based CBT is to reduce\\nnegativity among family member interactions, as well as help family members adjust to living with\\nsomeone with psychotic symptoms. These three components within the family intervention program'),\n",

Social skills training. Given the poor interpersonal functioning among individuals with\\nschizophrenia, social skills training is another type of treatment commonly suggested to improve\\npsychosocial functioning. Research has indicated that poor interpersonal skills not only predate the\\nonset of the disorder but also remain significant even with the management of symptoms via\\nantipsychotic medications. Impaired ability to interact with individuals in a social, occupational, or\\nrecreational setting is related to poorer psychological adjustment (Bellack, Morrison, Wixted, &\\nMueser, 1990). This can lead to greater isolation and reduced social support among individuals with\\nschizophrenia. As previously discussed, social support has been identified as a protective factor of\\nsymptom exacerbation, as it buffers psychosocial stressors that are often responsible for the\\nexacerbation of symptoms. Learning how to interact with others appropriately (e.g., establish eye\\ncontact, engage in reciprocal conversations, etc.) through role-play in a group therapy setting is one\\neffective way to teach positive social skills.\\n     12.5.3.2. Inpatient Hospitalizations. More commonly viewed as community-based treatments,\\ninpatient hospitalization programs are essential in stabilizing patients in psychotic episodes. Generally\\nspeaking, patients will be treated on an outpatient basis; however, there are times when their symptoms\\nexceed the needs of an outpatient service. Short-term hospitalizations are used to modify antipsychotic\\nmedications and implement additional psychological treatments so that a patient can safely return to\\ntheir home. These hospitalizations generally last for a few weeks as opposed to a long-term treatment\\noption that would last months or years (Craig & Power, 2010).\\nIn addition to short-term hospitalizations, there are also partial hospitalizations where an individual\\nenrolls in a full-day program but returns home for the evening. These programs provide individuals with\\nintensive therapy, organized activities, and group therapy programs that enhance social skills training.\\nResearch supports the use of partial hospitalizations as individuals enrolled in these programs tend to\\ndo better than those who enter outpatient care (Bales et al., 2014).\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nPsychopharmacological treatment options for schizophrenia spectrum disorders include\\nantipsychotic drugs such as Thorazine, Chlorpromazine, Clozaril, Risperdal, and Abilify.\\nPsychological treatment options for schizophrenia spectrum disorders include CBT, the goal of\\nwhich is to improve the interpretations and understandings of symptoms (and experiences) which\\nwill reduce associated distress.\\nFamily interventions for schizophrenia spectrum disorders include psychoeducation, problem-\\nsolving skills, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), social skills training, and inpatient/partial\\nhospitalizations.\\n \\nSection 12.5 Review Questions'),\n",

Overview of Personality Disorders\\nAccording to the DSM-5-TR, personality traits are “…enduring patterns of perceiving, relating to, and\\nthinking about the environment and oneself that are exhibited in a wide range of social and personality\\ncontexts while a personality disorder “…is an enduring pattern of inner experience and behavior that\\ndeviates markedly from the norms and expectations of the individual’s culture, is pervasive and\\ninflexible, and has an onset in adolescence or early adulthood, is stable over time, and leads to distress\\nor impairment” (APA, 2022, pg. 733). Personality disorders have four defining features, which include\\ndistorted thinking patterns, problematic emotional responses, over- or under-regulated impulse control,\\nand interpersonal difficulties. While these four core features are universal among all ten personality\\ndisorders, the DSM-5-TR divides the personality disorders into three different clusters based on\\nsymptom similarities.\\nCluster A is described as the odd or eccentric cluster and consists of paranoid, schizoid, and\\nschizotypal personality disorders. The common feature between these three disorders is social\\nawkwardness and social withdrawal. Often these behaviors are similar to those seen in schizophrenia;\\nhowever, they tend to be not as extensive or impactful on daily functioning as seen in schizophrenia. In\\nfact, there is a strong relationship between Cluster A personality disorders among individuals who have\\na relative diagnosed with schizophrenia (Chemerinksi & Siever, 2011).\\nCluster B is the dramatic, emotional, or erratic cluster and consists of antisocial, borderline, histrionic,\\nand narcissistic personality disorders. Individuals with these personality disorders often experience\\nproblems with impulse control and emotional regulation. Due to the dramatic, emotional, and erratic\\nnature of these disorders, it is nearly impossible for individuals to establish healthy relationships with\\nothers.\\nAnd finally, Cluster C is the anxious or fearful cluster and consists of avoidant, dependent, and\\nobsessive-compulsive personality disorders. As you read through the descriptions of the disorders, you\\nwill see an overlap with symptoms from the anxiety and depressive disorders. Cluster C disorders have\\nthe most treatment options of all the personality disorders, likely because the overlapping anxiety and\\ndepressive disorders have well-established treatment options.\\nTo meet the criteria for any personality disorder, the individual must display the pattern of behaviors in'),\n",

Children cannot be diagnosed with a personality disorder. Some children may present with\\nsimilar symptoms, such as poor peer relationships, odd or eccentric behaviors, or peculiar thoughts and\\nlanguage; however, a formal personality disorder diagnosis cannot be made until the age of 18. The\\nDSM-5-TR reports that median prevalence across several countries is 3.6% for Cluster A disorders,\\n4.5% for Cluster B, 2.8% for Cluster C, and 10.5% for any personality disorder.\\nIt is also noted that the clustering approach used in the DSM has not been consistently validated and\\nhas some serious limitations. As written, “An alternative to the categorical approach is the dimensional\\nperspective that personality disorders represent maladaptive variants of personality traits that merge\\nimperceptibly into normality and into one another” (APA, 2022, pg. 734). Interested readers should\\nconsult Section III of the DSM (beginning on page 881) for a full description of the dimensional model\\nfor personality disorders and an alternative model for personality disorders that utilizes a hybrid\\ndimensional-categorical model approach.\\n \\n13.1.2. Cluster A\\n     13.1.2.1. Paranoid personality disorder. Paranoid personality disorder is characterized by a\\nmarked distrust or suspicion of others. Individuals interpret and believe that other’s motives and\\ninteractions are intended to harm them, and therefore, they are skeptical about establishing close\\nrelationships outside of family members—although, at times, even family members’ actions are also\\nbelieved to be malevolent (APA, 2022). Individuals with paranoid personality disorder often feel as\\nthough they have been deeply and irreversibly hurt by others even though they lack evidence to support\\nthat these others intended to or did hurt them. Because of these persistent suspicions, they will doubt\\nrelationships that show true loyalty or trustworthiness. Compliments are misinterpreted and they may\\nview an offer of help as a criticism that they are not doing a good enough job on their own.\\nIndividuals with paranoid personality disorder are also hesitant to share any personal information or\\nconfide in others as they fear the information will be used against them. Additionally, benign remarks or\\nevents are often viewed as demeaning or threatening. For example, if an individual with paranoid\\npersonality disorder was accidentally bumped into at the store, they would interpret this action as\\nintentional, with the purpose of causing them injury. Because of this, individuals with paranoid\\npersonality disorder are quick to hold grudges and unwilling to forgive insults or injuries- whether\\nintentional or not. They are known to quickly and angrily counterattack, either verbally or physically, in\\nsituations where they feel they were insulted (APA, 2022).\\n     13.1.2.2. Schizoid personality disorder. Individuals with schizoid personality disorder display\\na persistent pattern of avoidance of social relationships, along with a limited range of emotional\\nexpression in interpersonal settings (APA, 2022). Similar to those with paranoid personality disorder,\\nindividuals with schizoid personality disorder do not have many close relationships; however, unlike\\nparanoid personality disorder, this lack of connection is not due to suspicious feelings, but rather, the\\nlack of desire to engage with others and the preference to engage in solitary behaviors. Individuals with\\nschizoid personality disorder are often viewed as “loners” and prefer activities where they do not have\\nto engage with others (APA, 2022). Established relationships rarely extend outside that of the family as\\nthey make no effort to start or maintain friendships.

In fact, individuals with schizoid personality disorder rarely reciprocate\\nfacial expressions or gestures typically displayed in normal conversations such as smiles or nods.\\nBecause of this lack of emotion, there is a limited need for attention or acceptance.\\n     13.1.2.3. Schizotypal personality disorder. Schizotypal personality disorder is characterized\\nby a range of impairment in social and interpersonal relationships due to discomfort in relationships,\\nalong with odd cognitive or perceptual distortions and eccentric behaviors (APA, 2022). Similar to those\\nwith schizoid personality disorder, individuals also seek isolation and have few, if any established\\nrelationships outside of family members.\\nOne of the most prominent features of schizotypal personality disorder is ideas of reference, or the\\nbelief that unrelated events pertain to them in a particular and unusual way. Ideas of reference also\\nlead to superstitious behaviors or preoccupation with paranormal activities that are not generally\\naccepted in their culture (APA, 2022). The perception of special or magical powers, such as the ability\\nto mind-read or control other’s thoughts, has also been documented in individuals with schizotypal\\npersonality disorder. Similar to schizophrenia, unusual perceptual experiences such as auditory\\nhallucinations, as well as unusual speech patterns of derailment or incoherence, are also present.\\nLike the other personality disorders within cluster A, there is a component of paranoia or\\nsuspiciousness of other’s motives. Additionally, individuals with schizotypal personality disorder display\\ninappropriate or restricted affect, thus impacting their ability to appropriately interact with others in a\\nsocial context. Significant social anxiety is often also present in social situations, particularly in those\\ninvolving unfamiliar people. The combination of limited affect and social anxiety contributes to their\\ninability to establish and maintain personal relationships; most individuals with schizotypal personality\\ndisorder prefer to keep to themselves to reduce this anxiety.\\n \\n13.1.3. Cluster B\\n     13.1.3.1. Antisocial personality disorder. The essential feature of antisocial personality\\ndisorder is the persistent pattern of disregard for, and violation of, the rights of others. This pattern of\\nbehavior begins in late childhood or early adolescence and continues throughout adulthood. While this\\nbehavior presents before age 15, the individual cannot be diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder\\nuntil the age of 18. Prior to age 18, the individual would be diagnosed with conduct disorder. Although\\nnot discussed in this book as it is a disorder of childhood, conduct disorder involves a repetitive and\\npersistent pattern of behaviors that violate the rights of others or major age-appropriate norms.\\nCommon behaviors of individuals with conduct disorder that go on to develop antisocial personality\\ndisorder are aggression toward people or animals, destruction of property, deceitfulness or theft, or\\nserious violation of rules (APA, 2022).\\nWhile commonly referred to as “psychopaths” or “sociopaths,” individuals with antisocial personality\\ndisorder fail to conform to social norms. This also includes legal rules as individuals with antisocial\\npersonality disorder are often repeatedly arrested for property destruction, harassing/assaulting others,\\nor stealing (APA, 2022). Deceitfulness is another hallmark symptom of antisocial personality disorder as\\nindividuals often lie repeatedly, generally to gain profit or pleasure. There is also a pattern of'),\n",

This impulsivity also contributes to their inability to hold\\njobs as they are more likely to impulsively quit their jobs (Hengartner et al., 2014). Employment\\ninstability, along with impulsivity, also impacts their ability to manage finances; it is not uncommon to\\nsee individuals with antisocial personality disorder with large debts that they are unable to pay\\n(Derefinko & Widiger, 2016).\\nWhile also likely related to impulsivity, individuals with antisocial personality disorder tend to be\\nextremely irritable and aggressive, repeatedly getting into fights. The marked disregard for their safety,\\nas well as the safety of others, is also observed in reckless behavior such as speeding, driving under the\\ninfluence, and engaging in sexual and substance abuse behavior that may put themselves at risk (APA,\\n2022).\\nOf course, the most known and devastating symptom of antisocial personality disorder is the lack of\\nremorse for the consequences of their actions, regardless of how severe they may be. Individuals often\\nrationalize their actions as the fault of the victim, minimize the harmfulness of the consequences of\\ntheir behaviors, or display indifference (APA, 2022). Overall, individuals with antisocial personality\\ndisorder have limited personal relationships due to their selfish desire and lack of moral conscience.\\n     13.1.3.2. Borderline personality disorder. Individuals with borderline personality disorder\\ndisplay a pervasive pattern of instability in interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affect (APA,\\n2022). The combination of these symptoms causes significant impairment in establishing and\\nmaintaining personal relationships. They will often go to great lengths to avoid real or imagined\\nabandonment. Fears related to abandonment can lead to inappropriate anger as they often interpret the\\nabandonment as a reflection of their own behavior. It is not uncommon to experience intense\\nfluctuations in mood, often observed as volatile interactions with family and friends (Herpertz &\\nBertsch, 2014).  Those with borderline personality disorder may be friendly one day and hostile the\\nnext.\\nTo prevent abandonment, individuals with borderline personality disorder will often exhibit impulsive\\nbehaviors such as self-harm and suicidal behavior. In fact, individuals with borderline personality\\ndisorder engage in more suicide attempts, and completion of suicide is higher among these individuals\\nthan the general public (Linehan et al., 2015). Other impulsive behaviors, such as non-suicidal self-\\ninjury (cutting) and sexual promiscuity, are frequently seen within this population, typically occurring\\nduring high-stress periods (Sansone & Sansone, 2012). They often have chronic feelings of emptiness\\nalong with painful feelings of aloneness. Occasionally, hallucinations and delusions are present,\\nparticularly of a paranoid nature; however, these symptoms are often transient and recognized as\\nunacceptable by the individual (Sieswerda & Arntz, 2007).\\n     13.1.3.3. Histrionic personality disorder. Histrionic personality disorder is the first\\npersonality disorder that addresses pervasive and excessive emotionality and attention-seeking. These\\nindividuals are usually uncomfortable in social settings unless they are the center of attention. To help\\ngain attention, the individual is often vivacious and dramatic, using physical gestures and mannerisms\\nalong with grandiose language. These behaviors are initially very charming to their audience; however,\\nthey begin to wear due to the constant need for attention to be on them. If the theatrical nature does\\nnot gain the attention they desire, they may go to great lengths to draw attention, such as using a\\nfictitious story or creating a dramatic scene.'),\n",

These sexually charged behaviors are not\\nonly directed at those in which they have a sexual or romantic interest but to the general public as well\\n(APA, 2022). They often spend a significant amount of time on their physical appearance to gain the\\nattention they desire.\\nIndividuals with histrionic personality disorder are easily suggestible. Their opinions and feelings are\\ninfluenced by not only their friends but also by current fads (APA, 2022). They also tend to exaggerate\\nrelationships, considering casual acquaintanceships as more intimate than they are.\\n     13.1.3.4. Narcissistic personality disorder. Like histrionic personality disorder, narcissistic\\npersonality disorder also centers around the individual; however, with narcissistic personality\\ndisorder, individuals display a pattern of grandiosity along with a lack of empathy for others (APA,\\n2022).  The grandiose sense of self leads to an overvaluation of their abilities and accomplishments.\\nThey often come across as boastful and pretentious, repeatedly proclaiming their superior\\nachievements. These proclamations may also be fantasized to enhance their success or power.\\nOftentimes they identify themselves as “special” and will only interact with others of high status.\\nGiven the grandiose sense of self, it is not surprising that individuals with narcissistic personality\\ndisorder need excessive admiration from others. While it appears that their self-esteem is hugely\\ninflated, it is very fragile and dependent on how others perceive them (APA, 2022).  Because of this,\\nthey may constantly seek out compliments and expect favorable treatment from others. When this sense\\nof entitlement is not upheld, they can become irritated or angry that their needs are not met.\\nA lack of empathy is also displayed in individuals with narcissistic personality disorder as they often\\nstruggle to (or choose not to) recognize the desires or needs of others. This lack of empathy also leads\\nto exploitation of interpersonal relationships, as they are unable to understand other’s feelings\\n(Marcoux et al., 2014). They often become envious of others who achieve greater success or possessions\\nthan them. Conversely, they believe everyone should be envious of their achievements, regardless of\\nhow small they may be.\\n \\n13.1.4. Cluster C\\n     13.1.4.1. Avoidant personality disorder. Individuals with avoidant personality disorder display\\na pervasive pattern of social inhibition due to feelings of inadequacy and increased sensitivity to\\nnegative evaluations (APA, 2022). The fear of being rejected drives their reluctance to engage in social\\nsituations so that they may prevent others from evaluating them negatively. This fear extends so far that\\nit prevents individuals from maintaining employment due to their intense fear of negative evaluation or\\nrejection.\\nSocially, they have very few if any friends, despite their desire to establish social relationships. They\\nactively avoid social situations in which they can develop new friendships out of the fear of being\\ndisliked or ridiculed. Similarly, they are cautious of new activities or relationships as they often\\nexaggerate the potential negative consequences and embarrassment that may occur; this is likely a\\nresult of their ongoing preoccupation with being criticized or rejected by others. Within intimate\\nrelationships, their fear of being shamed or ridiculed leads to restraint, and they view themselves as\\nsocially inept (APA, 2022).'),\n",

You likely did as there is a great deal of overlap between the two disorders. So,\\nhow do they differ if they are to be regarded as separate diagnostic categories in the DSM? This\\ndifference is linked to self-concept. How so?\\nIn social anxiety disorder the negative self-concept is unstable and less pervasive and entrenched.\\nIn avoidant personality disorder, the negative self-concept is more stable as an enduring and\\npervasive pattern, typical of personality traits.\\nAdditionally, avoidant personality disorder frequently occurs in the absence of social anxiety disorder\\nand some separate risk factors have been identified for the two.\\n     13.1.4.2. Dependent personality disorder.   Dependent personality disorder is characterized\\nby pervasive and excessive need to be taken care of by others (APA, 2022). This intense need leads to\\nsubmissive and clinging behaviors as they fear they will be abandoned or separated from their parent,\\nspouse, or another person with whom they are in a dependent relationship. They are so dependent on\\nthis other individual that they cannot make even the smallest decisions without first consulting with\\nthem and gaining their approval or reassurance. They often allow others to assume complete\\nresponsibility for their life, making decisions in nearly all aspects of their lives. Rarely will they\\nchallenge these decisions as their fear of losing this relationship greatly outweighs their desire to\\nexpress their own opinion. Should the relationship end, the individual experiences significant feelings of\\nhelplessness and quickly seeks out another relationship to replace the old one (APA, 2022).\\nWhen they are on their own, individuals with dependent personality disorder express difficulty initiating\\nand engaging in tasks on their own. They lack self-confidence and feel helpless when they are left to\\ncare for themselves or engage in tasks on their own. So that they do not have to engage in tasks alone,\\nindividuals will go to great lengths to seek out support of others, often volunteering for unpleasant\\ntasks if it means they will get the reassurance they need (APA, 2022).\\n     13.1.4.3. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD). OCPD is defined by an\\nindividual’s preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, and ability to control situations that they\\nlose flexibility, openness, and efficiency in everyday life (APA, 2022). One’s preoccupation with details,\\nrules, lists, order, organization, or schedules overshadows the larger picture of the task or activity. In\\nfact, the need to complete the task or activity is significantly impacted by the individual’s self-imposed\\nhigh standards and need to complete the task perfectly, that the task often does not get completed. The\\ndesire to complete the task perfectly often causes the individual to spend an excessive amount of time\\non the task, occasionally repeating it until it is to their standard. Due to repetition and attention to fine\\ndetail, the individual often does not have time to engage in leisure activities or engage in social\\nrelationships. Despite the excessive amount of time spent on activities or tasks, individuals with OCPD\\nwill not seek help from others, as they are convinced that the others are incompetent and will not\\ncomplete the task up to their standard.\\nPersonally, individuals with OCD are rigid and stubborn, particularly with their morals, ethics, and'),\n",

Not only do they hold these standards for themselves, but they also expect others to have\\nsimilarly high standards, thus causing significant disruption to their social interactions. The rigid and\\nstubborn behaviors are also seen in their financial status, as they are known to live significantly below\\ntheir means to prepare financially for a potential catastrophe (APA, 2022). Similarly, they may have\\ndifficulty discarding worn-out or worthless items, despite their lack of sentimental value.\\nThough on the surface it may appear that OCPD and OCD are one and the same, there is a distinct\\ndifference as the personality disorder lacks definitive obsessions and compulsions (APA, 2022). In fact,\\nmost individuals with OCD do not have a pattern of behavior that meets criteria for this personality\\ndisorder.\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nPersonality disorders share the features of distorted thinking patterns, problematic emotional\\nresponses, over- or under-regulated impulse control, and interpersonal difficulties and divide into\\nthree clusters.\\nCluster A personality disorders are described as the odd/eccentric cluster and share as the\\ncommon feature social awkwardness and social withdrawal.

A large\\nmeta-analysis exploring the data on the comorbidity of major depressive disorder and personality\\ndisorders indicated a high diagnosis of major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and dysthymia\\n(Friborg, Martinsen, Martinussen, Kaiser, Overgard, & Rosenvinge, 2014). Further exploration of major\\ndepressive disorder suggested the lowest rate of diagnosis in Cluster A disorders, higher rate in Cluster\\nB disorders, and the highest rate in Cluster C disorders. While the relationship between bipolar\\ndisorder and personality disorders has not been consistently clear, the most recent findings report a\\nhigh comorbidity between Cluster B personality disorders, with the exception of OCPD (which is in\\nCluster C), which had the highest comorbidity rate than any other personality disorder.  Overall analysis\\nof dysthymia suggested that it is the most diagnosed depressive disorder among all personality\\ndisorders.\\nA more detailed analysis exploring the prevalence rates of the four main anxiety disorders (generalized\\nanxiety disorder, specific phobia, social phobia, and panic disorder) among individuals with various\\npersonality disorders found a clear relationship specific to personality disorders and anxiety disorders\\n(Skodol, Geier, Grant, & Hasin, 2014). More specifically, individuals diagnosed with borderline and\\nschizotypal personality disorders were found to have an additional diagnosis of one of the four main\\nanxiety disorders. Individuals with narcissistic personality disorder were more likely to be diagnosed\\nwith generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder; schizoid and avoidant personality disorders\\nreported significant rates of generalized anxiety disorder; avoidant personality disorder had a higher\\ndiagnosis rate of social phobia. Substance use disorders occur less frequently across the ten personality\\ndisorders but are most common in individuals diagnosed with antisocial, borderline, and schizotypal\\npersonality disorders (Grant et al., 2015).

Because of this lack of concrete evidence, researchers argue that it is difficult to\\ndetermine what role genetics plays into the development of these disorders compared to that of\\nenvironmental influences. Therefore, while there is likely a biological predisposition to personality\\ndisorders, exact causes cannot be determined at this time.\\nResearch on the development of schizotypal personality disorder has identified similar biological causes\\nto that of schizophrenia—high activity of dopamine and enlarged brain ventricles (Lener et al., 2015).\\nSimilar differences in neuroanatomy may explain the high similarity of behaviors in both schizophrenia\\nand schizotypal personality disorder.\\nSurprisingly, antisocial personality disorder and borderline personality disorder also have similar\\nneurological changes. More specifically, individuals with both disorders reportedly show deficits in\\nserotonin activity (Thompson, Ramos, & Willett, 2014). These low levels of serotonin activity in\\ncombination with deficient functioning of the frontal lobes—particularly the prefrontal cortex which is\\nused in planning, self-control, and decision making—as well as an overly reactive amygdala, may explain\\nthe impulsive and aggressive nature of both antisocial and borderline personality disorder (Stone,\\n2014).\\n \\n13.4.2. Psychological\\nPsychodynamic, cognitive, and behavioral theories are among the most common psychological models\\nused to explain the development of personality disorders. Although much is still speculation, the\\nfollowing are general etiological views with regards to each specific theory.\\n     13.4.2.1. Psychodynamic. The psychodynamic theory places a large emphasis on negative early\\nchildhood experiences and how these experiences impact an individual’s inability to establish healthy\\nrelationships in adulthood. More specifically, individuals with personality disorders report higher levels\\nof childhood stress, such as living in impoverished environments, exposure to domestic violence, and\\nexperiencing repeated maltreatment (Kumari et al., 2014). Additionally, high levels of childhood neglect\\nand parental rejection are also observed in personality disorder patients, with early parental loss and\\nrejection leading to fears of abandonment throughout an individual’s life (Newnham & Janca, 2014;\\nRoepke & Varter, 2014; Caligor & Clarkin, 2010).\\nPsychodynamic theorists believe that maltreatment in early childhood has the potential to negatively\\naffect an individual’s sense of self and their perception of others, leading to the development of a\\npersonality disorder. For example, an individual who was neglected as a young child and deprived of\\nlove may report a lack of trust in others as an adult, a characteristic of antisocial personality disorder\\n(Meloy & Yakeley, 2010). Difficulty trusting others or beliefs that they are unable to be loved may also\\nimpact one’s ability or desire to establish social relationships, as seen in many personality disorders,\\nparticularly schizoid. Because of these early childhood deficits, individuals may also overcompensate in\\ntheir relationships to convince themselves that they are worthy of love and affection (Celani, 2014).\\nConversely, individuals may respond to their early childhood experiences by becoming emotionally\\ndistant, using relationships as a sense of power and destructiveness.\\n     13.4.2.2.

Overall deficiencies in thinking can lead individuals with personality\\ndisorders to develop inaccurate perceptions of others (Beck, 2015). These dysfunctional beliefs likely\\noriginate from the interaction between a biological predisposition and undesirable environmental\\nexperiences. Maladaptive thought patterns and strategies are strengthened during aversive life events\\nas a protective mechanism and ultimately come together to form patterns of behavior displayed in\\npersonality disorders (Beck, 2015).\\nCognitive distortions such as dichotomous thinking, also known as all-or-nothing thinking, are\\nobserved in several personality disorders. More specifically, dichotomous thinking explains rigidity and\\nperfectionism in OCPD, and the lack of self-sufficiency among individuals with dependent and\\nborderline personality disorders (Weishaar & Beck, 2006). Discounting the positive also explains the\\nunderlying mechanisms for avoidant personality disorder (Weishaar & Beck, 2006). For example,\\nindividuals who have been routinely criticized or rejected during childhood may have difficulty\\naccepting positive feedback from others, expecting only to receive rejection and harsh criticism. In fact,\\nthey may employ these misattributions to positive feedback to support their ongoing theory that they\\nare constantly rejected and criticized by others.\\n     13.4.2.3. Behavioral. Behavioral theorists apply three major theories to explain the development of\\npersonality disorders: modeling, reinforcement, and lack of social skills. In modeling, an individual\\nlearns maladaptive social patterns and behaviors by directly observing family members engaging in\\nsimilar behaviors (Gaynor & Baird, 2007). While we cannot discredit the biological component of the\\nfamilial influence, research does support an additive modeling or imitating component to the\\ndevelopment of personality disorders, especially antisocial personality disorder (APA, 2022).\\nReinforcement, or rewarding of maladaptive behaviors is also observed in the development of many\\npersonality disorders. Parents may unintentionally reward aggressive behaviors by giving in to a child’s\\ndesires to cease the situation or prevent escalation of behaviors. When this is done repeatedly over\\ntime, children (and later as adults) continue with these maladaptive behaviors as they are effective in\\ngaining their needs and wants. On the other side, there is some speculation that excessive\\nreinforcement or praise during childhood may contribute to the grandiose sense of self observed in\\nindividuals with narcissistic personality disorder (Millon, 2011).\\nFinally, failure to develop normal social skills may explain the development of some personality\\ndisorders, such as avoidant personality disorder (Kantor, 2010).\\n \\n13.4.3. Social\\n     13.4.3.1. Family dysfunction. High levels of psychological and social dysfunction within families\\nhave also been identified as contributing factors to the development of personality disorders. High\\nlevels of poverty, unemployment, family separation, and witnessing domestic violence are routinely\\nobserved in individuals diagnosed with personality disorders (Paris, 1996). While formalized research\\nhas yet to explore the relationship between SES and personality disorders fully, correlational studies\\nsuggest a link between poverty, unemployment, and poor academic achievement with increased levels\\nof personality disorder diagnoses (Alwin, 2006).\\n     13.4.3.2.

This sense of self is the mechanism in which individuals\\nview themselves within their social context, while also informing attitudes and expectations of others. A\\nchild who experiences significant maltreatment, whether it be through neglect or physical, emotional,\\nor sexual abuse, is at-risk for an underdeveloped or absent sense of self. Due to the lack of affection,\\ndiscipline, or autonomy during childhood, these individuals are unable to engage in appropriate\\nrelationships as adults as seen across the spectrum of personality disorders.\\nAnother way childhood maltreatment contributes to personality disorders is through the emotional\\nbonds or attachments developed with primary caregivers. John Bowlby thoroughly researched the\\nrelationship between attachment and emotional development as he explored the need for affection in\\nHarlow monkeys (Bowlby, 1998). Based on Bowlby’s research, four attachment styles have been\\nidentified: secure, anxious, ambivalent, and disorganized. While securely attached children\\ngenerally do not develop personality disorders, those with anxious, ambivalent, and disorganized\\nattachment are at an increased risk of developing various disorders. More specifically, those with an\\nanxious attachment are at-risk for developing internalizing disorders, ambivalent are at-risk for\\ndeveloping externalizing disorders, and disorganized are at-risk for dissociative symptoms and\\npersonality-related disorders (Alwin, 2006).\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nBiological causes of personality disorders have not been identified in most disorders, the\\nexception being schizotypal which has similar biological causes as schizophrenia and antisocial\\nand borderline personality disorders which have similar neurological changes.\\nPsychological causes of personality disorders include negative early childhood experiences;\\nmaladaptive thought patterns and cognitive distortions; and modeling, reinforcement, and lack of\\nsocial skills.\\nSocial causes of personality disorders include high levels of psychological and social dysfunction\\nwithin families and maltreatment.\\n \\nSection 13.4 Review Questions\\nWhat personality disorders are most explained by the biological model?1.\\nHow does the psychodynamic model explain the development of personality disorders?2.\\nWhat cognitive distortions are most discussed with respect to personality disorders?3.\\nWhat are the three behavioral theories used to explain the development of personality disorders?4.\\nDiscuss the role of attachment and how theorists have used it to explain the development of5.\\npersonality disorders.'),\n",

Treatment\\n \\nSection Learning Objectives\\nDescribe treatment options for personality disorders.\\n \\n13.5.1. Cluster A\\nIndividuals with personality disorders within Cluster A often do not seek out treatment as they do not\\nidentify themselves as someone who needs help (Millon, 2011). Of those that do seek treatment, the\\nmajority do not enter it willingly. Furthermore, due to the nature of these disorders, individuals in\\ntreatment often struggle to trust the clinician as they are suspicious of the clinician’s intentions\\n(paranoid and schizotypal personality disorder) or are emotionally distant from the clinician as they do\\nnot have a desire to engage in treatment due to lack of overall emotion (schizoid personality disorder;\\nKellett & Hardy, 2014, Colli, Tanzilli, Dimaggio, & Lingiardi, 2014). Because of this, treatment is known\\nto move very slowly, with many patients dropping out before any resolution of symptoms.\\nWhen patients are enrolled in treatment, cognitive-behavioral strategies are most commonly used with\\nthe primary intention of reducing anxiety-related symptoms. Additionally, attempts at cognitive\\nrestructuring—both identifying and changing maladaptive thought patterns—are also helpful in\\naddressing the misinterpretations of other’s words and actions, particularly for individuals with\\nparanoid personality disorder (Kellett & Hardy, 2014). Schizoid personality disorder patients may\\nengage in CBT techniques to help experience more positive emotions and more satisfying social\\nexperiences, whereas the goal of CBT for schizotypal personality disorder is to evaluate unusual\\nthoughts or perceptions objectively and to ignore the inappropriate thoughts (Beck & Weishaar, 2011).\\nFinally, behavioral techniques such as social-skills training may also be implemented to address ongoing\\ninterpersonal problems displayed in the disorders.\\n \\n13.5.2. Cluster B\\n     13.5.2.1. Antisocial personality disorder. Treatment options for antisocial personality disorder\\nare limited and generally not effective (Black, 2015). Like Cluster A disorders, many individuals are\\nforced to participate in treatment, thus impacting their ability to engage in and continue with\\ntreatment. Cognitive therapists have attempted to address the lack of morality and encourage patients\\nto think about the needs of others (Beck & Weishaar, 2011).\\n     13.5.2.2. Borderline personality disorder. Borderline personality disorder is the one personality\\ndisorder with an effective treatment option—Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT). DBT is a form of\\ncognitive-behavioral therapy developed by Marsha Linehan (Linehan, Armstrong, Suarez, Allmon, &'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'producer': 'mPDF 7.0.3', 'creator': 'Washington State University', 'creationdate': \"20240717221411+00'00'\", 'title': 'Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders', 'subject': 'JM', 'author': 'Alexis Bridley and Lee W.

There are four main goals of DBT: reduce suicidal behavior, reduce therapy interfering\\nbehavior, improve quality of life, and reduce post-traumatic stress symptoms.\\nWithin DBT, five main treatment components collectively help to reduce harmful behaviors (i.e., self-\\nmutilation and suicidal behaviors) and replace them with practical, life-enhancing behaviors (Gonidakis,\\n2014). The first component is skills training. Generally performed in a group therapy setting, individuals\\nengage in mindfulness, distress tolerance, interpersonal effectiveness, and emotion regulation. Second,\\nindividuals focus on enhancing motivation and applying skills learned in the previous component to\\nspecific challenges and events in their everyday life. The third, and often the most distinctive aspect of\\nDBT, is the use of telephone and in vivo coaching for DBT patients from the DBT clinical team. It is not\\nuncommon for patients to have the cell phone number of their clinician for 24/7 availability of in-the-\\nmoment support. The fourth component, case management, consists of allowing the patient to become\\ntheir own “case manager” and effectively use the learned DBT techniques to problem-solve ongoing\\nissues. Within this component, the clinician will only intervene when absolutely necessary. Finally, the\\nconsultation team, is a service for the clinicians providing the DBT treatment. Due to the high demands\\nof borderline personality disorder patients, the consultation team offers support to the providers in their\\nwork to ensure they remain motivated and competent in DBT principles to provide the best treatment\\npossible.\\nSupport for the effectiveness of DBT in borderline personality disorder patients has been implicated in\\nseveral randomized control trials (Harned, Korslund, & Linehan, 2014; Neacsiu, Eberle, Kramer,\\nWisemeann, & Linehan, 2014). More specifically, DBT has shown to significantly reduce suicidality and\\nself-harm behaviors in those with borderline personality disorders. Additionally, the drop-out rates for\\ntreatment are extremely low, suggesting that patients value the treatment components and find them\\nuseful in managing symptoms.\\n     13.5.2.3. Histrionic personality disorder. Individuals with histrionic personality disorder are\\nmore likely to seek out treatment than other personality disorder patients. Unfortunately, due to the\\nnature of the disorder, they are very difficult patients to treat as they are quick to employ their\\ndemands and seductiveness within the treatment setting. The overall goal for the treatment of histrionic\\npersonality disorder is to help the patient identify their dependency and become more self-reliant.\\nCognitive therapists utilize techniques to help patients change their helpless beliefs and improve\\nproblem-solving skills (Beck & Weishaar, 2011).\\n     13.5.2.4. Narcissistic personality disorder. Of all the personality disorders, narcissistic\\npersonality disorder is among the most difficult to treat (with maybe the exception of antisocial\\npersonality disorder). Most individuals with narcissistic personality disorder only seek out treatment for\\nthose disorders secondary to their personality disorder, such as depression (APA, 2022). The focus of\\ntreatment is to address the grandiose, self-centered thinking, while also trying to teach patients how to\\nempathize with others (Beck & Weishaar, 2014).\\n \\n13.5.3. Cluster C\\nWhile many individuals within avoidant and OCPD personality disorders seek out treatment to address\\ntheir anxiety or depressive symptoms, it is often difficult to keep them in treatment due to distrust or\\nfear of rejection from the clinician.  Treatment goals for avoidant personality disorder are similar to that\\nof social anxiety disorder. CBT techniques, such as identifying and challenging distressing thoughts,'),\n",

Specific to OCPD,\\ncognitive techniques aimed at changing dichotomous thinking, perfectionism, and chronic worrying\\nhelp manage symptoms of OCPD. Behavioral treatments such as gradual exposure to various social\\nsettings, along with a combination of social skills training, have been shown to improve individuals’\\nconfidence prior to engaging in social outings when treating avoidant personality disorder (Herbert,\\n2007). Antianxiety and antidepressant medications commonly used to treat anxiety disorders have also\\nbeen used with minimal efficacy; furthermore, symptoms resume as soon as the medication is\\ndiscontinued.\\nUnlike other personality disorders where individuals are skeptical of the clinician, individuals with\\ndependent personality disorder try to place obligations of their treatment on the clinician. Therefore,\\none of the main treatment goals for dependent personality disorder patients is to teach them to accept\\nresponsibility for themselves, both in and outside of treatment (Colli, Tanzilli, Dimaggio, & Lingiardi,\\n2014). Cognitive strategies such as challenging and changing thoughts on helplessness and inability to\\ncare for oneself have been minimally effective in establishing independence. Additionally, behavioral\\ntechniques such as assertiveness training have also shown some promise in teaching individuals how to\\nexpress themselves within a relationship. Some argue that family or couples therapy would be\\nparticularly helpful for those with dependent personality disorder due to the relationship between the\\npatient and another person being the primary issue; however, research on this treatment method has\\nnot yielded consistently positive results (Nichols, 2013).\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nIndividuals with a Cluster A personality disorder do not often seek treatment and when they do,\\nstruggle to trust the clinician (paranoid and schizotypal) or are emotionally distant from the\\nclinician (schizoid).

Therefore, it is important that individuals presenting with\\nthese symptoms complete a medical assessment to better determine the etiology behind the disorder.\\nThere are three main categories of neurocognitive disorders—delirium, major neurocognitive disorder,\\nand mild neurocognitive disorder. Within major and minor neurocognitive disorders are several\\nsubtypes due to the etiology of the disorder. For this book, we will review diagnostic criteria for both\\nmajor and minor neurocognitive disorders, followed by a brief description of the various disease\\nsubtypes in the etiology section.\\nIt is important to note as well that the criteria for the various NCDs are based on defined cognitive\\ndomains. These include the following, with a brief explanation of what it is:\\nComplex attention – Sustained, divided, or selective attention and processing speed1.\\nExecutive function – planning, decision-making, overriding habits, mental flexibility, and2.\\nresponding to feedback/error correction\\nLearning and memory – includes cued recall, immediate or long-term memory, and implicit3.\\nlearning\\nLanguage – Includes expressive language and receptive language4.\\nPerceptual-motor – Includes any abilities related to visual perception, gnosis, perceptual-motor5.\\npraxis, or visuo-constructional\\nSocial cognition – Includes recognition of emotions and theory of mind6.\\n \\n14.1.1. Delirium\\nDelirium is characterized by a notable disturbance in attention along with reduced awareness of the\\nenvironment. The disturbance develops over a short period of time, representing a change from\\nbaseline attention and awareness, and fluctuates in severity during the day. There is also a disturbance\\nin cognitive performance that is significantly altered from one’s usual behavior. Disturbances in\\nattention are often manifested as difficulty sustaining, shifting, or focusing attention. Additionally, an\\nindividual experiencing an episode of delirium will have a disruption in cognition, including confusion of\\nwhere they are. Disorganized thinking, incoherent speech, and hallucinations and delusions may also be\\nobserved during periods of delirium.\\nDelirium is associated with increased functional decline and risk of being placed in an institution. That\\nsaid, most people with delirium recover fully with or without treatment, especially if not elderly, but if\\nundetected or the underlying cause is untreated, it may progress to stupor, coma, seizures, or death\\n(APA, 2022).\\n \\n14.1.2. Major Neurocognitive Disorder\\nIndividuals with major neurocognitive disorder show a significant decline in both overall cognitive\\nfunctioning (see the previously listed six domains) as well as the ability to independently meet the'),\n",

While\\nit is not necessary, it is helpful to have documentation of the cognitive decline via neuropsychological\\ntesting within a controlled, standardized testing environment. Information from close family members\\nor caregivers is also important in documenting the decline and impairment in areas of functioning.\\nWithin the umbrella of major neurocognitive disorder is dementia, a striking decline in cognition and\\nself-help skills due to a neurocognitive disorder. The DSM-5-TR (APA, 2022) refrained from using this\\nterm in diagnostic categories as it is often used to describe the natural decline in degenerative\\ndementias that affect older adults; whereas neurocognitive disorder is the preferred term used to\\ndescribe conditions affecting younger individuals such as impairment due to traumatic brain injuries or\\nother medical conditions. Therefore, while dementia is accurate in describing those experiencing major\\nneurocognitive disorder due to age, it is not reflective of those experiencing neurocognitive issues\\nsecondary to an injury or illness.\\n \\n14.1.3. Mild Neurocognitive Disorder\\nIndividuals with mild neurocognitive disorder demonstrate a modest decline in one of the listed\\ncognitive domains. The decline in functioning is not as extensive as that seen in major neurocognitive\\ndisorder, and the individual does not experience difficulty independently engaging in daily activities.\\nHowever, they may require assistance or extra time to complete these tasks, particularly if the cognitive\\ndecline continues to progress.\\nIt should be noted that the primary difference between major and mild neurocognitive disorder is the\\nseverity of the decline and independent functioning. Some argue that the two are earlier and later\\nstages of the same disease process (Blaze, 2013). Conversely, individuals can go from major to mild\\nneurocognitive disorder following recovery from a stroke or traumatic brain injury (Petersen, 2011).\\nThe DSM-5-TR describes major and mild NCD as existing on a spectrum of cognitive and functional\\nimpairment (APA, 2022, pg. 685).\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nThe criteria for the various NCDs are based on the cognitive domains of complex attention,\\nexecutive function, learning and memory, language, perceptual-motor, and social cognition.\\nDelirium is characterized by a notable disturbance in attention or awareness and cognitive\\nperformance that is significantly altered from one’s usual behavior.\\nMajor neurocognitive disorder is characterized by a significant decline in both overall cognitive\\nfunctioning as well as the ability to independently meet the demands of daily living.\\nMild neurocognitive disorder is characterized by a modest decline in one of the listed cognitive\\nareas with no interference in one’s ability to complete daily activities.'),\n",

As you will see, most of these neurocognitive disorders are\\nboth degenerative, meaning the symptoms and cognitive deficits become worse over time, as well as\\nrelated to a medical condition or disease.\\nPer the DSM-5-TR (APA, 2022), an individual will meet diagnostic criteria for either mild or major\\nneurocognitive disorder as listed above. In order to specify the type of neurocognitive disorder,\\nadditional diagnostic criteria specific to one of the following subtypes must be met.\\n \\n14.3.1. Alzheimer’s Disease\\nAlzheimer’s disease is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder. While the primary symptom of\\nAlzheimer’s disease is the gradual progression of impairment in cognition, it is also important to\\nidentify concrete evidence of cognitive decline. This can be done in one of two ways: via genetic testing\\nof the individual or a documented family history of the disease, or, through clear evidence of cognitive\\ndecline over time by repeated standardized neuropsychological evaluations (APA, 2022). It is crucial to\\nidentify these markers in making the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease as some individuals present with\\nmemory impairment but eventually show a reversal of symptoms; this is not the case for individuals\\nwith Alzheimer’s disease.\\n     14.3.1.1. Causes of Alzheimer’s disease. Autopsies of individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer’s\\ndisease identify two abnormal brain structures— beta-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary\\ntangles— both of which are responsible for neuron death, inflammation, and loss of cellular\\nconnections (Lazarov, Mattson, Peterson, Pimplika, & van Praag, 2010). It is believed that beta-amyloid\\nplaques, large bundles of plaque that develop between neurons, appear before the development of\\ndementia symptoms. As these plaque bundles increase in size and number, cognitive symptoms and\\nimpaired daily functioning become evident to close family members. Neurofibrillary tangles are believed\\nto appear after the onset of dementia symptoms and are found inside of cells, affecting the protein that\\nhelps transport nutrients in healthy cells. Both beta-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles impact\\nthe health of neurons within the hippocampus, amygdala, and the cerebral cortex, areas associated with\\nmemory and cognition (Spires-Jones & Hyman, 2014).\\nResearchers have identified additional genetic and environmental influences in the development of\\nAlzheimer’s disorder. Genetically, the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene that helps to eliminate beta-\\namyloid by-products from the brain, has been implicated in the development of Alzheimer’s disorder.\\nOne of the three variants of this gene, the e4 allele, appears to reduce the production of ApoE, thus\\nincreasing the number of beta-amyloid plaques within the brain. However, not all individuals with the\\ne4 allele develop Alzheimer’s disease; therefore, this explanation may better explain a vulnerability to\\nAlzheimer’s disease as opposed to the cause of the disease.'),\n",

More\\nspecifically, neurons shrinking or dying within the hypothalamus, thalamus, and the locus ceruleus have\\nbeen linked to declining cognition (Selkoe, 2011, 1992). Acetylcholine-secreting neurons within the\\nbasal forebrain also appear to shrink or die, contributing to Alzheimer’s disease symptoms (Hsu et al.,\\n2015).\\nEnvironmental toxins such as high levels of zinc and lead may also contribute to the development of\\nAlzheimer’s disease. More precisely, zinc has been linked to the clumping of beta-amyloid proteins\\nthroughout the brain.  Although lead has largely been phased out of environmental toxins due to\\nnegative health consequences, current elderly individuals were exposed to these toxic levels of lead in\\ngasoline and paint as young children. There is some speculation that lead and other pollutants may\\nimpact cognitive functioning in older adults (Richardson et al., 2014).\\n     14.3.1.2. Onset of Alzheimer’s disease.  Alzheimer’s disease is defined by the onset of symptoms.\\nEarly-onset Alzheimer’s disease occurs before the age of 65. While only a small percentage of\\nindividuals experience early onset of the disease, those that do experience early disease progression\\nappear to have a more genetically influenced condition and a higher rate of family members with the\\ndisease.\\nLate-onset Alzheimer’s disease occurs after the age of 65 and has less of a familial influence. This onset\\nappears to occur due to a combination of biological, environmental, and lifestyle factors (Chin-Chan,\\nNavarro-Yepes, & Quintanilla-Vega, 2015). Nearly 30% of individuals within this class of diagnosis have\\nthe ApoE gene that fails to eliminate the beta-amyloid proteins from various brain structures. It is\\nbelieved that the combination of the presence of this gene along with environmental toxins and lifestyle\\nchoices (i.e., more stress) impact the development of Alzheimer’s disease.\\n \\n14.3.2. Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)\\nTBIs occur when an individual experiences significant trauma or damage to the head. Neurocognitive\\ndisorder due to TBI is diagnosed when persistent cognitive impairment is observed immediately\\nfollowing the head injury, along with one or more of the following symptoms: loss of consciousness,\\nposttraumatic amnesia, disorientation and confusion, or neurological impairment (APA, 2022).\\nThe presentation of symptoms varies among individuals and depends largely on the location of the\\ninjury and the intensity of the trauma. Furthermore, the effects of a TBI can be temporary or\\npermanent. Symptoms generally range from headaches, disorientation, confusion, irritability, fatigue,\\npoor concentration, and emotional and behavioral changes. More severe injuries can result in more\\nsignificant neurological symptoms such as seizures, paralysis, and visual disturbances.\\nMajor or mild NCD due to TBI may be comorbid with specified or unspecified depressive, anxiety, or\\npersonality disorders and PTSD. Rates of suicidal ideation are as high as 10% with rates of suicide\\nattempt hovering around 0.8% to 1.7% (APA, 2022).\\nThe most common type of TBI is a concussion. A concussion occurs when there is a significant blow to\\nthe head, followed by changes in brain functioning. It often causes immediate disorientation or loss of\\nconsciousness, along with headaches, dizziness, nausea, and sensitivity to light (Alla, Sullivan, &\\nMcCrory, 2012). While symptoms of a concussion are usually temporary, there can be more permanent'),\n",

The media has brought\\nconsiderable attention to this with the recent discussions of chronic traumatic encephalopathy\\n(CTE) which is a progressive, degenerative condition due to repeated head trauma. CTEs are most\\ncommonly seen in athletes (i.e., football players) and military personnel (Baugh et al., 2012). In addition\\nto the neurological symptoms, psychological symptoms such as depression and poor impulse control\\nhave been observed in individuals with CTE. These individuals also appear to be at greater risk for the\\ndevelopment of dementia (McKee et al., 2013).\\n \\n14.3.3. Vascular Disorders\\nNeurocognitive disorders due to vascular disorders can occur from a one-time event such as a stroke or\\nongoing subtle disruptions of blood flow within the brain (APA, 2022). The occurrence of these vascular\\ndisorders general begins with atherosclerosis, or the clogging of arteries due to a build-up of plaque.\\n The plaque builds up over time, eventually causing the artery to narrow, thus reducing the amount of\\nblood able to pass through to other parts of the body. When these arteries within the brain become\\nentirely obstructed, a stroke occurs. The lack of blood flow during a stroke results in the death of\\nneurons and loss of brain function. There are two types of strokes—a hemorrhagic stroke that occurs\\nwhen a blood vessel bursts within the brain and an ischemic stroke, which is when a blood clot blocks\\nthe blood flow in an artery within the brain (American Stroke Association, 2017).\\nWhile strokes can occur at any age, the majority of strokes occur after age 65 (Hall, Levant, &\\nDeFrances, 2012). A wide range of cognitive, behavioral, and emotional changes occur following a\\nstroke. Symptoms are generally dependent on the location of the stroke within the brain as well as the\\nextensiveness of damage to those brain regions (Poels et al., 2012). For example, strokes that occur on\\nthe left side of the brain tend to cause problems with speech and language, as well as physical\\nmovement on the right side of the body; whereas strokes that occur on the right side of the brain tend\\nto cause problems with impulsivity and impaired judgement, short-term memory loss, and physical\\nmovement on the left side of the body (Hedna et al., 2013).\\nAfter Alzheimer’s disease, vascular disease is the second most common cause of NCD and population\\nprevalence estimates are 0.98% for those between the ages of 71-79 years, 4.09% for individuals aged\\n80-89 years, and 6.19% for those aged 90 years and up. Within three months of a stroke, 20%-30% of\\npeople are diagnosed with dementia. Finally, stroke is more common in men up to age 65 and after that,\\nit shifts to women. Vascular disease is frequently comorbid with major or mild NCD due to Alzheimer’s\\ndisease and depression.\\n \\n14.3.4. Substance/Medication-Induced Major or Mild NCD\\nSignificant cognitive changes occur due to repetitive drug and alcohol abuse. Delirium can be observed\\nin individuals with extreme substance intoxication, withdrawal, or even when multiple substances have\\nbeen used within a close period (APA, 2022). While delirium symptoms are often transient during these\\nstates, mild neurocognitive impairment due to heavy substance abuse may remain until a significant\\nperiod of abstinence is observed (Stavro, Pelletier, & Potvin, 2013).'),\n",

Dementia with Lewy Bodies\\nSymptoms associated with neurocognitive disorder due to Lewy bodies include significant fluctuations\\nin attention and alertness; recurrent visual hallucinations; impaired mobility; and sleep disturbances\\nsuch as rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (APA, 2022). While the trajectory of the illness\\ndevelops more rapidly than Alzheimer’s disease, the survival period is similar in that most individuals do\\nnot survive longer than eight years post-diagnosis (Lewy Body Dementia Association, 2017).\\nLewy bodies are irregular brain cells that result from the buildup of abnormal proteins in the nuclei of\\nneurons. These brain cells deplete the cortex of acetylcholine, which causes the behavioral and\\ncognitive symptoms observed in both dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson’s disease. The motor\\nsymptoms seen in both these disorders occur from the depletion of dopamine by the Lewy body nerve\\ncells that accumulate in the brain stem.\\n \\n14.3.6. Major or Mild Frontotemporal NCD\\nFrontotemporal NCD causes “progressive development of behavioral and personality change and/or\\nlanguage impairment”  (APA, 2022, pg. 696). For the behavioral variant, individuals display at least\\nthree of the following: behavioral disinhibition, apathy or inertia, loss of sympathy or empathy,\\npreservative or compulsive behavior, or hyperorality and dietary changes. For the language variant,\\nthey show prominent decline in language ability (i.e., speech production, word finding, object naming,\\ngrammar, or word comprehension). There is relative sparing of learning and memory and perceptual-\\nmotor functioning. Individuals with frontotemporal NCD commonly present in their 50s though the age\\nof onset has a range of age 20 to 80 years. The median survival is 6-11 years after symptom onset and\\n3-4 years after diagnosis (APA, 2022).\\n \\n14.3.7. Parkinson’s Disease\\nThe awareness of Parkinson’s disease has increased in recent years due in large part to Michael J. Fox’s\\nearly diagnosis in 1991. It affects approximately 630,000 individuals (Kowal, Dall, Chakrabarti, Storm,\\n& Jain, 2013). While many are aware of the tremors of hands, arms, legs, and face, the other three main\\nsymptoms of Parkinson’s disease are rigidity of the limbs and trunk; slowness in initiating movement;\\nand drooping posture or impaired balance and coordination (National Institute of Neurological\\nDisorders and Stroke, 2017). These motor symptoms are generally present at least one year prior to the\\nbeginning of cognitive decline, although severity and progression of symptoms vary significantly from\\nperson to person.\\nOnset of Parkinson’s disease is typically from age 50 to 89 years. Mild NCD develops early in the course\\nof Parkinson’s disease while Major NCD does not occur until individuals are much older. The prevalence\\nof Parkinson’s disease in the U.S. increases with age and is more common in men than women. The\\ndisease is comorbid with Alzheimer’s disease and cerebrovascular disease. Depression, psychosis, REM\\nsleep behavior disorder, apathy, and motor symptoms can make functional impairment worse (APA,\\n2022).'),\n",

Huntington’s Disease\\nHuntington’s disease is a rare genetic disorder that involves involuntary movement, progressive\\ndementia, and emotional instability. Due to the degenerative nature of the disorder, there is a shortened\\nlife-expectancy as death typically occurs 15-20 years post-onset of symptoms (Clabough, 2013).\\nAlthough symptoms can present at any time, the average age of symptom presentation is during middle\\nadulthood (between ages 35 and 45 years; APA, 2022). Symptoms generally begin with neurocognitive\\ndecline, particularly in executive function, along with changes in mood and personality. As symptoms\\nprogress, more physical symptoms present, such as facial grimaces, difficulty speaking, and repetitive\\nmovements. Because there is no treatment for Huntington’s disease, the severity of the cognitive and\\nphysical impairments ultimately leads to complete dependency and the need for full-time care. Suicide\\nis among the leading causes of death in Huntington’s disease (APA, 2022).\\n \\n14.3.9. HIV Infection\\nNot many people are aware that cognitive impairment is sometimes the first symptom of untreated HIV.\\nWhile symptoms vary among individuals, slower mental processing, impaired executive function,\\nproblems with more demanding attentional tasks, and difficulty learning new information are among the\\nmost common early signs (APA, 2022). When HIV becomes active in the brain, significant alterations of\\nmental processes occur, thus leading to a diagnosis of neurocognitive disorder due to HIV infection.\\nSignificant impairment can also occur due to HIV-infection related inflammation throughout the central\\nnervous system.\\nFortunately, antiretroviral therapies used in treating HIV have been effective in reducing and\\npreventing the onset of severe cognitive impairments; however, HIV-related brain changes still occur in\\nnearly half of all patients on antiretroviral medication. There is hope that once antiretroviral therapies\\ncan cross the blood-brain barrier in the central nervous system, there will be a significant improvement\\nin the prevalence of HIV-related neurocognitive disorder (Vassallo et al., 2014).\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nMost neurocognitive disorders are degenerative meaning they become worse over time.\\nAlzheimer’s disease is characterized by the gradual progression of impairment in cognition as\\nwell as the presence of beta-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles.\\nTBIs occur when an individual experiences significant trauma or damage to the head with the\\nmost common type being a concussion.\\nVascular disorders generally begin with atherosclerosis which leads to a stroke.\\nSignificant cognitive changes occur due to repetitive drug and alcohol abuse such as delirium.\\nDementia with Lewy bodies is characterized by significant fluctuations in attention and alertness;\\nrecurrent visual hallucinations; impaired mobility; and sleep disturbance.\\nFrontotemporal NCD causes progressive declines in language or behavior due to the degeneration\\nin the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain.'),\n",

Due to possible negative\\nside effects of the medications, these drugs are prescribed to individuals in the early or middle stages of\\nAlzheimer’s as opposed to those with advanced disease. Researchers have also explored treatment\\noptions aimed at preventing the build-up of beta-amyloid and neurofibrillary tangles; however, this\\nresearch is still in its infancy (Alzheimer’s Association, 2017a)\\nParkinson’s disease has also found success in pharmacological treatment options. The medication\\nlevodopa increases dopamine availability, which provides relief of both physical and cognitive\\nsymptoms.

Psychological\\nAmong the most effective psychological treatment options for individuals with neurocognitive disorders\\nare the use of cognitive and behavioral strategies. More specifically, engaging in various cognitive\\nactivities such as computer-based cognitive stimulation programs, reading books, and following the\\nnews, have been identified as effective strategies in preventing or delaying the onset of Alzheimer’s\\ndisease (Szalavits, 2013; Wilson, Segawa, Boyle, & Bennett, 2012).\\nEngaging in social skills and self-care training are additional behavioral strategies used to help improve\\nfunctioning in individuals with neurocognitive deficits. For example, by breaking down complex tasks\\ninto smaller, more attainable goals, as well as simplifying the environment (i.e., labeling location of\\nitems, removing clutter), individuals can successfully engage in more independent living activities.\\n \\n14.4.3. Support for Caregivers\\nSupporting caregivers is an important treatment option to include as the emotional and physical toll on\\ncaring for an individual with a neurocognitive disorder is often underestimated. According to the\\nAlzheimer’s Association (2017b), nearly 90% of all individuals with Alzheimer’s disease are cared for by\\na relative. The emotional and physical demands on caring for a family member who continues to decline\\ncognitively and physically can lead to increased anger and depression in a caregiver (Kang et al. 2014).\\nIt is important that medical providers routinely assess caregivers’ psychosocial functioning, and\\nencourage caregivers to participate in caregiver support groups, or individual psychotherapy to address\\ntheir own emotional needs.\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nPharmacological interventions for Alzheimer’s disease target the neurotransmitters acetylcholine\\nand glutamate and newer research is focused on the build-up of beta-amyloid and neurofibrillary'),\n",

Civil Commitment\\n     15.1.2.1. What is civil commitment? When individuals with mental illness behave in erratic or\\npotentially dangerous ways, to either themselves or others, then something must be done. The\\nresponsibility to act falls on the government through what is called parens patriae or “father of the\\ncountry” or “country as parent.” Action, in this case, involves involuntary commitment in a hospital or\\nmental health facility and is done to protect the individual and express concern over their well-being,\\nmuch like a parent would do for their child. An individual can voluntarily admit themselves to a mental\\nhealth facility, and upon doing so, staff will determine whether treatment and extended stay are\\nneeded.\\n     15.1.2.2. Criteria for civil commitment. Though states vary in the criteria used to establish the\\nneed for civil commitment, some requirements are common across states. First, the individual must\\npresent a clear danger to either themselves or others. Second, the individual demonstrates that they are\\nunable to care for themself or make decisions about whether treatment or hospitalization is necessary.\\nFinally, the individual believes they are about to lose control, and so, needs treatment or care in a\\nmental health facility.\\n     15.1.2.3. Assessment of “dangerousness.” Dangerousness can best be defined as the person’s'),\n",

Most people believe that those who are mentally\\nill are more dangerous than those free of mental illness, especially when espousing self-reported\\nconservatism and RWA (Right-Wing Authoritarianism; Gonzales, Chan, and Yanos, 2017; DeLuca and\\nYanos, 2015) or after tragic events such as a mass shooting (Metzl & MacLeish, 2015). The media plays\\na role in this, and as McGinty et al. (2014) found, 70% of news coverage of serious mental illness (SMI)\\nand gun violence over a 16-year period (1997 to 2012) focused on extreme events and described\\nspecific shootings by persons with SMI. The authors wrote, “Even in thematic news coverage focused\\non describing the general problem of SMI and gun violence, the majority of news stories did not\\nmention that most people with SMI are not violent or that we lack tools capable of accurately\\nidentifying persons with SMI who are at heightened risk of committing future violence.” They concluded\\nthat media coverage of persons with SMI as violent might contribute to negative public attitudes.\\nRozel & Mulvey (2017) showed that mental illness is a weak risk factor for violence though this is not to\\nsay that the mentally ill do not commit violent acts. The authors write, “…it has been documented\\nrepeatedly that people who report diagnosable levels of psychiatric symptoms also report more\\ninvolvement in acts of violence toward others than the general population reports.” Approximately 4%\\nof criminal violence can be attributed to the mentally ill (Metzl & MacLeish, 2015), while those with\\nmental illness are three times more likely to be targets and not perpetrators of violence (Choe et al.,\\n2008).\\nRegardless of this, we do attempt to identify the level of dangerousness a person may exhibit or have\\nthe potential to exhibit. How easy is it to make this prediction? As you might think, it can be very\\ndifficult. First, the definition of dangerousness is vague. It implies physical harm, but what about\\npsychological abuse or the destruction of property? Second, past criminal activity is a good predictor of\\nfuture dangerousness but is often not admissible in court. Third, context is critical; in some situations,\\nthe person is perfectly fine, but in other circumstances, like having to wait in line at your local\\nDepartment of Motor Vehicles, the person experiences considerable frustration and eventually anger or\\nrage.\\n     15.1.2.4. Procedures in civil commitment. The process for civil commitment does vary somewhat\\nstate-to-state, but some procedures are held in common. First, a family member, mental health\\nprofessional, or primary care practitioner, may request that the court order an examination of an\\nindividual. If the judge agrees, two professionals, such as a mental health professional or physician, are\\nappointed to examine the person in terms of their ability for self-care, need for treatment, psychological\\ncondition, and likelihood to inflict harm on self or others. Next, a formal hearing gives the examiners a\\nchance to testify as to what they found. Testimonials may also be provided by family and friends, or by\\nthe individual him/herself. Once testimonies conclude, the judge renders judgment about whether\\nconfinement is necessary and, if so, for how long. Typical confinements last from 6 months to 1 year,\\nbut an indefinite period can be specified too. In the latter case, the individual has periodic reviews and\\nassessments. In emergencies, the process stated above can be skipped and short-term commitment\\nmade, especially if the person is an imminent threat to themself or others.\\nBefore we move on, consider for a minute that a person who is accused of a crime is innocent until\\nproven guilty, has a trial, and if found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt (or almost complete certainty)\\nis only then incarcerated. This is not true for the mentally ill, who may be committed to a facility\\nwithout ever having committed a crime or having a trial, but simply because they were judged as having\\nthe potential to do so (or was seen as dangerous). This potential means that there must be “clear and\\nconvincing” proof, which the U.S. Supreme Court defines as 75% certainty. The standard to commit is'),\n",

Criminal Commitment\\nWhen people are accused of crimes but found to be mentally unstable, they are usually sent to a mental\\nhealth institution for treatment. This is called criminal commitment. Individuals may plead not guilty\\nby reason of insanity (NGRI) or as it is also called, the insanity plea. When a defendant pleads NGRI\\nthey are acknowledging their guilt for the crime (actus rea) but wish to be seen as not guilty since they\\nwere mentally ill at the time (mens rea).\\nThe origins of the modern definition of insanity go back to Daniel M’Naghten in 1843 England. He\\nmurdered the secretary to British Prime Minister, Robert Peel, during an attempted assassination of the\\nPrime Minister. He was found to be not guilty due to delusions of persecution, which outraged the\\npublic and led to calls for a more precise definition of insanity. The M’Naghten rule states that having\\na mental disorder at the time of a crime does not mean the person was insane. The individual also had\\nto be unable to know right from wrong or comprehend the act as wrong. But how do you know what the\\nperson’s level of awareness was when the crime was committed?\\nDissatisfaction with the M’Haghten rule led some state and federal courts in the U.S. to adopt instead\\nthe irresistible impulse test (1887), which focused on the inability of a person to control their\\nbehaviors. The issue with this rule is in distinguishing when a person is unable to maintain control\\nrather than choosing not to exert control over their behavior. This meant there were two choices in the\\nU.S. in terms of how insanity was defined – the M’Haghten rule and the irresistible impulse test. A third\\ntest emerged in 1954 from the Durham v. United States case, though it was short-lived. The Durham\\ntest, or products test, stated that a person was not criminally responsible if their crime was a product\\nof a mental illness or defect. It offered some degree of flexibility for the courts but was viewed as too\\nflexible. Since almost anything can cause something else, the term product is too vague.\\nIn 1962, the American Law Institute (ALI) offered a compromise to the three precepts in use at the time.\\nThe American Law Institute standard stated that people are not criminally responsible for their\\nactions if, at the time of their crime, they had a mental disorder or defect that did not allow them to\\ndistinguish right from wrong and to obey the law. Though this became the standard, it also became\\ncontroversial when defense attorneys used it as the basis to have John Hinckley, accused of attempting\\nto assassinate President Ronald Regan, found not guilty by reason of insanity in 1982.\\nPublic uproar led the American Psychiatric Association to reiterate the stance of the M’Naghten test\\nand assert people were only insane if they did not know right from wrong when they committed their\\ncrime. The Federal Insanity Defense Reform ACT (IDRA) of 1984 “was the first comprehensive\\nfederal legislation governing the insanity defense and the disposition of individuals suffering from a\\nmental disease or defect who are involved in the criminal justice system.” The ACT included the\\nfollowing provisions:\\nsignificantly modified the standard for insanity previously applied in the federal courts\\nplaced the burden of proof on the defendant to establish the defense by clear and convincing\\nevidence\\nlimited the scope of expert testimony on ultimate legal issues\\neliminated the defense of diminished capacity, created a special verdict of “not guilty only by'),\n",

The jurors can then convict the accused and suggest they receive\\ntreatment. Though this looks like an excellent alternative, jurors are often confused by it (Melville &\\nNaimark, 2002), NGRI verdicts have not been reduced, and all prisoners have access to mental health\\ncare anyway. Hence it differs from a guilty verdict in name only (Slovenko, 2011; 2009).\\nA final concept critical to this discussion is whether the defendant is competent to stand trial and\\nrefers to the accused’s mental state at the time of psychiatric examination after arrest and before going\\nto trial. To be deemed competent, federal law dictates that the defendant must have a rational and\\nfactual understanding of the proceedings and be able to rationally consult with counsel when\\npresenting their defense (Mossman et al., 2007; Fitch, 2007). This condition guarantees criminal and\\ncivil rights and ensures the accused understands what is going on during the trial and can aid in their\\ndefense. If they are not fit or competent, then they can be hospitalized until their mental state improves.\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nForensic psychology is when clinical psychology is applied to the legal arena in terms of\\nassessment, treatment, and evaluation, though it can include research from other subfields to\\ninclude cognitive and social psychology.\\nCivil commitment occurs when a person acts in potentially dangerous ways to themselves or\\nothers and can be initiated by the person or the government.\\nDangerousness is defined as the person’s capacity of harming themselves or others and implies\\nphysical harm but not necessarily psychological abuse or the destruction of property.\\nCriminal commitment occurs when a person is accused of a crime but found to be mentally\\nunstable.\\nSeveral rules or tests have been attempted to determine if a person is responsible for their actions\\nat the time a crime was committed.

They include:\\nRight to Treatment – In the 1966 case of Rouse v. Cameron, the D.C.

Stickney, a federal court ruled that the state\\nof Alabama was constitutionally obligated to provide all people who were committed to\\ninstitutions with adequate treatment and had to offer more therapists, privacy, exercise, social\\ninteractions, and better living conditions for patients. In the case of O’Connor v. Donaldson\\n(1975), the court ruled that patient’s cases had to be reviewed periodically to see if they could be\\nreleased. As well, if they are not a danger and are able to survive on their own or with help from\\nfamily or friends, that they be released.\\nRight to Refuse Treatment – As patients have the right to request treatment, they too have the\\nright to refuse treatment such as biological treatment, psychotropic medications (Riggins v.\\nNevada, 1992), and electroconvulsive therapy.\\nRight to Less Restrictive Treatment – In Dixon v. Weinberger (1975), a U.S. District Court\\nruled that individuals have a right to receive treatment in facilities less restrictive than mental\\ninstitutions.

The Therapist-Client Relationship\\n \\nSection Learning Objectives\\nDescribe three concerns related to the therapist-client relationship.\\n \\nThree concerns are of paramount importance in terms of the therapist-client relationship. These include\\nthe following:\\nConfidentiality – As you might have learned in your introductory psychology course,\\nconfidentiality guarantees that information about you is not disseminated without your consent.\\nThis applies to students participating in research studies as well as patients seeing a therapist.\\nPrivileged communication – Confidentiality is an ethical principle while privileged\\ncommunication is a legal one, and states that confidential communications cannot be\\ndisseminated without the patient’s permission. There are a few exceptions to this which include\\nthe client being younger than 16, when they are a dependent elderly person and a victim of a\\ncrime, or when the patient is a danger to him or herself or others, to name a few.\\nDuty to Warn – In the 1976 Tarasoff v. the Board of Regents of the University of California\\nruling, the California Supreme Court said that a patient’s right to confidentiality ends when there\\nis a danger to the public, and that if a therapist determines that such a danger exists, they are\\nobligated to warn the potential victim.

We will explore disinhibited social engagement disorder in terms\\nof: (1) how the child presents and (2) the history of the child. Let’s start with how the child presents.\\nThese children, unlike children with reactive attachment disorder described below, tend to be overly\\nsocial and interact with complete strangers. The child may walk up to someone in a store they have\\nnever met and hug them or even walk away with them. They may do this without ever hesitating when\\nseparating from their caregiver and might not even look to check back with their caregiver.\\nIn terms of the history of the child, these children often experience impaired caregiving, which means\\nthat the caregiver does not sufficiently care for the child on a consistent basis.  This could result from a\\nchild simply not being attended by their caregivers. Perhaps the parent does not interact with them\\nregularly, or the basic needs of the child are not appropriately cared for, such as food, hygiene, and\\nshelter. The child may be in a setting in which there are not enough caregivers to care for them\\nconsistently (e.g., an orphanage in which there are only a few caretakers with several infants), or they\\nmay not have had one consistent caregiver (e.g., they moved from one foster care setting to another\\nregularly). These situations interrupt the attachment and security of a developing child. It should be'),\n",

Signs of the disorder often persist even\\nafter these other signs of neglect are absent. As such, it is not uncommon for children with disinhibited\\nsocial engagement disorder to present with no current signs of neglect. The DSM adds that the\\ncondition can present in children who show no signs of disordered attachment. “Thus, disinhibited\\nsocial engagement disorder may be seen in children with a history of neglect who lack attachments or\\nwhose attachments to their caregivers range from disturbed to secure” (APA, 2022, pg. 299).\\nThe functional consequences of disinhibited social engagement disorder include impairment of a young\\nchild’s abilities to relate interpersonally to adults and peers.

ADHD and externalizing\\ndisorders are often comorbid in younger children and in middle childhood (APA, 2022).\\n      16.1.2.4. Differential Diagnosis. Disinhibited social engagement disorder must be differentiated\\nfrom ADHD. Unlike ADHD, children with disinhibited social engagement disorder do not show\\ndifficulties with either attention or hyperactivity (APA, 2022).\\nAdditionally, the medical condition of Williams syndrome, caused by a partial chromosomal deletion,\\nmay mimic disinhibited social engagement disorder symptoms (Zeanah, et al., 2016). These children\\nstruggle with social discrimination and tend to be overly approaching to strangers. However, they\\ndisplay this behavior despite not having a history of neglect/trauma symptoms (Zeanah, et. al, 2016). As\\nsuch, if a child is socially disinhibited, but has no history of neglect, disinhibited social engagement\\ndisorder is not the likely diagnosis. In fact, it may be that the behavior is caused by a more medically-\\nbased etiology such as Williams syndrome.\\n \\n16.1.2. Reactive Attachment Disorder\\n      16.1.2.1. Clinical Presentation. We will discuss reactive attachment disorder in much the same\\nway as disinhibited social engagement disorder starting with how the child presents. Children with this\\ndisorder typically present as detached from others or emotionally withdrawn. They do not seek comfort\\nfrom caregivers or respond to physical touch when distressed. These children typically have low levels\\nof expressed emotions, particularly positive emotions. They may experience unexplained irritability,\\nsadness, and fearfulness.\\nIn terms of the history of the child, similar to disinhibited social engagement disorder, the child will\\nhave experienced a pattern of extremes of insufficient care manifested as one of the following: social\\nneglect or deprivation; repeated changes of primary caregivers that restrict their ability to form stable\\nattachments, and/or rearing in unusual settings that do not allow for the formation of attachments.

Reactive\\nattachment disorder impairs a young child’s ability to relate interpersonally to adults or peers and\\ncauses functional impairment across many domains of early childhood.\\n      16.1.2.2. Prevalence. The prevalence of reactive attachment disorder is largely unknown and\\nconsidered extremely rare.  Young children exposed to severe neglect often present with reactive\\nattachment disorder before being placed in foster care or institutions. Despite this, the disorder is\\nuncommon and occurs in less than 10% of neglected children, even when severe neglect has occurred\\n(APA, 2022).\\n      16.1.2.3. Comorbidity. Cognitive and language delays, severe malnutrition, as well as stereotypies\\nare often comorbid with reactive attachment disorder. There may be a comorbidity with ADHD, though\\nthis is not clearly established.\\n      16.1.2.4. Differential Diagnosis. Due to the significant deficit in emotional-social reciprocity,\\nautism spectrum disorder must be differentiated from reactive attachment disorder. Whether or not a\\nchild was neglected, and the presence or absence of restricted or repetitive behaviors/interests, help\\ndifferentiate the two disorders (APA, 2022). If a child has no history of severe neglect or abuse, the\\ndiagnosis of autism spectrum disorder is more likely than reactive attachment disorder. If the child does\\nnot have restricted/repetitive behaviors/interests, the child is not likely to be diagnosed with autism\\nspectrum disorder, and as such, deficits in social/emotional reciprocity are more likely to be explained\\nby reactive attachment disorder, particularly if there is a significant neglect/abuse history.\\nFor more on disinhibited social engagement disorder and reactive attachment disorder please visit:\\nhttps://opentext.wsu.edu/behavioral-disorders-childhood/chapter/module-4-disinhibited-social-engageme\\nnt-disorder-and-reactive-attachment/\\n \\n16.1.3. Pica\\n      16.1.3.1. Clinical Presentation. Pica is the act of eating items that are not food on a regular or\\nrecurring basis over a period of at least one month. These nonnutritive, nonfood substances could\\ninclude grass, chalk, dirt, paper, hair, soap, wool, paint, gum, pebbles, coal, ash, or starch, to name a\\nfew. Pica can impair physical functioning but any impairment in social functioning usually occurs in\\nconjunction with other disorders. The behavior is inappropriate to the developmental level of the child,\\nso it should not be diagnosed before age 2 to exclude developmentally normal mouthing of objects\\nleading to ingestion, typical of infants. Also, the behavior should not be part of a culturally supported or\\nsocially normative practice such as ingesting a particular grass for medicinal or spiritual purposes (APA,\\n2022). Pica is not often associated with specific biological abnormalities, though deficiencies in vitamins\\nand minerals such as iron and zinc, have been reported.\\nPica may occur more frequently in disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (or other mental health\\ndisorders); however, a clinician must be careful to ensure that the act of eating nonfood items is to a\\nhigher degree than would be expected if another disorder is present. For example, if a child regularly\\nattempts to eat grass because they like the oral stimulation of it, and are diagnosed with autism\\nspectrum disorder, a clinician must determine if the individual is attempting to ingest a nonfood item,'),\n",

If the individual is only trying to orally stimulate, they would not\\nbe diagnosed with pica.\\n      16.1.3.2. Prevalence. Limited data suggests that the prevalence of pica is around 5% of school-\\nage children and a third of pregnant women engage in pica, especially if they have food insecurity (APA,\\n2022; Murray, Thomas, Hinz, Munsch, & Hilbert, 2018). Some studies indicate that pica is more\\ncommon in males than females (El-Nemer, Alian, Salah-Eldin, Khalil; 2014) whereas others do not show\\na significant difference between genders (APA, 2022; Murray et al., 2018). A worldwide meta-analysis\\nshowed a prevalence of 28% during pregnancy and/or the postpartum period (APA, 2022).\\n      16.1.3.3. Comorbidity. Autism spectrum disorder and intellectual developmental disorder\\n(intellectual disability) are the two most common comorbid diagnoses. Less common are schizophrenia\\nand OCD. Pica may also be comorbid with trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder), excoriation (skin-\\npicking) disorder, and avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder.\\n \\n16.1.4. Rumination Disorder\\n      16.1.4.1. Clinical Presentation. Rumination disorder is the frequent act of regurgitating food\\nover a period of at least 1 month with no medical explanation such as gastroesophageal reflux and in\\nthe absence of a body-image/weight-related reason such as anorexia, bulimia, and binge-eating\\ndisorder. An individual may rechew and then eject the food from the mouth or re-swallow (APA, 2022).\\nFunctional consequences of rumination disorder include growth delay due to malnutrition secondary to\\nrepeated regurgitation. Though the onset of the disorder can occur at any time during life, when it\\nbegins in infancy, the age at onset is between ages 3 and 12 months, and it can be fatal.\\n      16.1.4.2. Prevalence. Limited European data suggests a prevalence of 1% to 2% of grade-school-\\nage children.\\n      16.1.4.3. Comorbidity. Rumination disorder also occurs more frequently in individuals with an\\nintellectual disability (Olden, 2001). It can occur in the context of a concurrent medical condition or\\nanother mental disorder such as generalized anxiety disorder.\\n \\n16.1.5. Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder\\n      16.1.5.1. Clinical Presentation. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder is a new disorder to\\nthe DSM 5 (APA, 2013) and replaces and extends the DSM-IV diagnosis of feeding disorder of infancy or\\nearly childhood (Norris & Katzman, 2015). It is an eating or feeding disturbance associated with at least\\none of the following: 1) significant weight loss, 2) significant nutritional deficiency, 3) dependence on\\nenteral feeding or oral nutrition supplements, and 4) marked interference with psychosocial\\nfunctioning. The disturbance is not better explained due to a lack of available food or a culturally\\nsanctioned practice.\\nThe food avoidance or restriction may occur due to the sensory characteristics of qualities of food such\\nas its appearance, color, smell, texture, taste, or temperature. It may occur due to a conditioned'),\n",

And for some, the food avoidance or restriction\\noccurs due to a lack of interest in eating or food.\\n      16.1.5.2. Prevalence. Prevalence rates are largely unknown. A study in Australia reported a\\nfrequency of 0.3% among individuals aged 15 years and up. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder is\\nmore common in children with autism spectrum disorder and when so, has a male predominance. This\\nis possibly due to sensory concerns and rigidity that leads to children having very specific preferences\\nfor foods. Children may actively refuse to eat many foods due to texture aversions. When autism\\nspectrum disorder is not comorbid, the disorder occurs about equally between males and females.\\n      16.1.5.3. Comorbidity. As mentioned, autism spectrum disorder is a common comorbid disorder.\\nOther neurodevelopmental disorders may be highly comorbid such as ADHD, intellectual development\\ndisorder (intellectual disability), anxiety disorders, and OCD (APA, 2022).\\n \\nFor more on pica, rumination disorder, and avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder please visit:\\nhttps://opentext.wsu.edu/behavioral-disorders-childhood/chapter/module-5-feeding-disorders/\\n \\n16.1.6. Enuresis\\n      16.1.6.1. Clinical Presentation. Enuresis is the repeated voiding of urine into bed or clothes and\\ncan be involuntary or intentional. It has occurred at least two times per week for the past three\\nconsecutive months. The child must also be at least five years of age. Mental health professionals can\\nspecify whether the enuresis is nocturnal only (i.e., urinary incontinence only while sleeping), diurnal\\nonly (i.e., urinary incontinence only while awake), or nocturnal and diurnal (i.e., both while asleep and\\nawake; APA, 2022). The nocturnal only type is most common and occurs during the first one-third of the\\nnight. Diurnal enuresis most commonly occurs in the early afternoon on school days or after coming\\nhome from school. The degree of impairment is a function of, “…the limitation on the child’s social\\nactivities (e.g., ineligibility for sleep-away camp) or its effect on the child’s self-esteem, the degree of\\nsocial ostracism by peers, and the anger, punishment, and rejection on the part of caregivers” (APA,\\n2022, pg. 401).\\n      16.1.6.2. Prevalence. Daytime incontinence has a prevalence between 3.2% and 9.0% in children\\naged 7 years, from 1.1.% to 4.2% in youth ages 11-13 years, and from 1.2% to 3.0% in adolescents ages\\n15-17 years of age. Nocturnal enuresis is more common in males than females.\\n      16.1.6.3. Comorbidity. Most children with enuresis do not have a comorbid mental disorder. That\\nsaid, the prevalence of comorbid behavioral and developmental symptoms does appear to be higher in\\nchildren with both diurnal and nocturnal enuresis than those without incontinence.\\n \\n16.1.7.

Mental health professionals will specify whether encopresis is with or without\\nconstipation and overflow incontinence (APA, 2022). The child often feels ashamed and may wish to\\navoid situations, such as going to camp, that might lead to embarrassment. Encopresis is associated\\nwith, “a significant decrease in health-related quality of life and family functioning, particularly in older\\nchildren” (APA, 2022, pg. 404). When the incontinence is clearly deliberate, oppositional defiant\\ndisorder or conduct disorder may also be present.\\n      16.1.7.2. Prevalence. Most children older than four years of age diagnosed with encopresis have\\nthe subtype “with constipation and overflow incontinence.” The disorder affects 1% to 4% of children in\\nhigh-income countries, while in some Asian countries a prevalence rate of 2% to 8% has been reported.\\nIt also affects children aged 4-6 years more than children aged 10-12 years. Encopresis is also higher\\namong children who were low-income youth or were abused or neglected early. The gender ratio\\nappears to be about equal in children younger than 5 years but is more common in boys than in girls\\namong older children.\\n      16.1.7.3. Comorbidity.

Intellectual Developmental Disorder (Intellectual Disability)\\n      16.2.1.1. Clinical Presentation. At the core of an intellectual disability is a deficit in cognitive or\\nintellectual functioning. Historically, we labeled individuals with this presentation of deficits as having\\nmental retardation, but this term was changed to intellectual disability with the passage of Public Law\\n111-256, also called Rosa’s law, to combat stigmatization and misuse of the term. While the terms\\nintellectual disability and intellectual developmental disorder are considered interchangeable, we will\\nuse intellectual developmental disorder in this book.\\nWhen considering intellectual developmental disorder there are two primary areas of major deficits –\\nintellectual functioning (Criterion A) and adaptive functioning (Criterion B; APA, 2022).'),\n",

Intellectual functioning (Criterion A). Intellectual or cognitive functioning refers to\\nour ability to problem solve, understand and analyze complex material, think abstractly, absorb\\ninformation from our environment, learn from experience, plan, judge, and reason. Critical components\\ninclude working memory, verbal comprehension, quantitative reasoning, cognitive efficacy, and\\nperceptual reasoning. An individual with intellectual developmental disorder has a significant deficit in\\nthis area as confirmed by clinical assessment and individualized, standardized, culturally appropriate\\nintelligence testing. The DSM-5-TR states that those with intellectual developmental disorder have\\nscores approximately two standard deviations or more below the population mean. If a test has a\\nstandard deviation of 15 and a mean of 100, their scores will fall in the 65-75 range (70+5; APA, 2022).\\n      16.2.1.1.2. Adaptive functioning (Criterion B). Adaptive skills are those that help us\\nsuccessfully navigate our daily lives. Our ability to understand safety signs in our environment, make\\nappointments, interact with others, complete hygiene routines, etc. are examples of adaptive\\nfunctioning.  These are the skills one needs to live independently and be socially responsible.\\nIndividuals with intellectual developmental disorder typically have adaptive skills that are far below\\nwhat is expected given their chronological age.\\nAccording to the DSM-5-TR (APA, 2022) adaptive functioning involves adaptive reasoning in three main\\ndomains: conceptual, social, and practical. First, the conceptual domain (also called the academic\\ndomain) involves competence in memory, language, math reasoning, problem-solving, etc. Second, the\\nsocial domain involves being aware of the thoughts and feelings of other people, showing empathy,\\ninterpersonal communication skills, and social judgment, for example. Finally, the practical domain\\ninvolves learning and self-management across life settings such as job responsibilities, personal care,\\nand recreation.\\n      16.2.1.1.3. Onset of intellectual developmental disorder (Criterion C). It should be noted\\nthat a third criterion must also be met– the onset of deficits described in criteria A and B must be\\npresent early in the neurodevelopmental period. As such, it is most frequently diagnosed in children.\\nIntellectual developmental disorder is not something one would “acquire” in adulthood. If an individual\\nexperiences cognitive and adaptive function decline in later years, this is not considered intellectual\\ndevelopmental disorder (a neurodevelopmental disorder) but is more likely a neurocognitive disorder\\nthat may be due to a number of things such as traumatic brain injury or dementia. As such, although an\\nindividual can go undiagnosed until adulthood, and then as an adult be diagnosed with intellectual\\ndevelopmental disorder, there must be significant and undoubtable evidence of cognitive delay and\\nadaptive functioning delay in the early developmental period. Otherwise, an adult would not be\\ndiagnosed with intellectual developmental disorder.\\n      16.2.1.1.4. Severity specifiers. Rather than IQ scores, intellectual developmental disorder is\\nassigned a severity specifier based on the level of delays related to adaptive functioning. Essentially, the\\nmore support someone needs, the more severe the intellectual disability. Severity ranges from Mild\\n(least severe), to Moderate, to Severe, and Profound (most severe; APA, 2022). Severity is considered in\\nrelation to the three domains of conceptual, social, and practical. For instance, a specifier of severe\\nwould result the child having little understanding of written language or concepts involving numbers,\\nquantity, and money (conceptual domain), speech and communication being focused on the here and\\nnow within everyday events (social domain), and not being able to make responsible decisions regarding\\nthe well-being of self or others, necessitating supervision at all times (practical domain).\\n      16.2.1.1.5.

This can\\nlead to increased rates of accidental injury, being exploited by others, possible victimization or physical\\nand sexual abuse, and unintentional criminal involvement. They may also become distressed about their\\nintellectual limitations (APA, 2022).\\n      16.2.1.1.6. Clarification on nomenclature. The DSM-5-TR uses the term intellectual\\ndevelopment disorder to clarify its relationship with the ICD-11 classification system which uses the\\nterm Disorders of Intellectual Development. The equivalent term of intellectual disability is placed in\\nparentheses for continued use. It should be noted that both terms (i.e., intellectual developmental\\ndisorder and intellectual disability) are used in the medical and research literature, while the term\\nintellectual disability is more commonly used by educators, advocacy groups, and the lay public.\\n      16.2.1.2. Prevalence. Intellectual development disorder occurs in approximately 1% of the overall\\ngeneral population while the global prevalence varies by country and level of development. Prevalence\\nis 16 per 1,000 in middle-income countries but 9 per 1,000 in high-income countries (APA, 2022).\\nIntellectual development disorder is more common in males than females, although sex ratios are\\ninconsistent in the literature (APA, 2022; Einfeld & Emerson, 2008). It is hypothesized that the reason\\nthere is a higher occurrence of intellectual development disorder in males is due to general genetic\\nvulnerability, often linked to X chromosome issues that males experience (Harris, 2006). Prevalence is\\nhigher in youth than in adults and there are no significant differences between ethnoracial groups.\\n      16.2.1.3. Comorbidity. Intellectual development disorder is often comorbid with other medical\\nand physical conditions as well as other neurodevelopmental conditions including autism and ADHD.\\nMoreover, depression, bipolar, and anxiety disorders are often comorbid with intellectual development\\ndisorder. Impulse-control disorders, major neurocognitive disorder, and stereotypic movement disorder\\nare frequently comorbid (APA, 2022).\\n      16.2.1.4. Onset. Onset of intellectual development disorder is in the developmental period, though\\netiology and severity of brain dysfunction affect exact age and characteristic features at onset. For\\nindividuals with more severe intellectual development disorder, delayed motor, language, and social\\nmilestones are typical within the first 2 years of life. For individuals with mild intellectual development\\ndisorder, impairments may not be identifiable until school age when problems with academic learning\\nare evident.\\n \\n16.2.2. Specific Learning Disorder\\n      16.2.2.1. Clinical Presentation. A specific learning disorder is characterized by persistent\\ndifficulties learning critical academic skills during the years of formal schooling such as reading of\\nsingle words accurately and fluently or arithmetic calculation; performance of the affected academic\\nskills being well below expected for age; learning difficulties being apparent in the early school years\\nfor most individuals, and that the learning difficulties are considered “specific” for four reasons. First,\\nthe learning difficulties are not better explained by intellectual developmental disorder, global\\ndevelopmental delay, hearing or vision disorders, or neurological or motor disorders. Second, they\\ncannot be attributed to more general external factors such as economic or environmental disadvantage.\\nThird, they cannot be attributed to neurological disorders such as a pediatric stroke, motor disorders,\\nor to vision or hearing disorders. Fourth, a learning difficulty can be restricted to one academic skill or\\ndomain.'),\n",

This method is referred to as the discrepancy model. While many still use this model, and\\nnothing in the DSM-5-TR disallows it, the DSM-5 criteria were rewritten to allow more flexibility.\\nUltimately, a discrepancy between one’s IQ and academic achievement is no longer required; however,\\nthere must be specific data indicating an individual is preforming significantly below what would be\\nexpected given their chronological age.\\nIn addition to significant academic deficits, there must be evidence that efforts (e.g., tutoring, increased\\nand specialized instruction) to improve abilities within the specific area have been made before\\ndiagnosing a specific learning disorder. This is to ensure that an individual has had full access to\\neducational material and supports before a professional assigns a learning disorder diagnosis to them.\\nIn school systems, this is where tiered interventions have come into play (more on this in Section 7.5).\\n      16.2.2.1.1. Domain/subskill specific specifiers. Once an individual has been diagnosed with a\\nlearning disorder, all academic domains and subskills that have been impaired should be noted as\\nfollows:\\nWith impairment in reading – The individual has trouble comprehending material, reading\\nfluently and quickly, or reading words accurately.\\nWith impairment in mathematics – The individual has trouble with number sense,\\nmemorization of arithmetic facts, math reasoning, and calculation.\\nWith impairment in written expression – The individual has trouble with accurately spelling\\nwords, using correct punctuation and grammar, or with writing clearly and organized.\\n      16.2.2.1.2. Matters of dyslexia and dyscalculia. Technically, dyslexia and dyscalculia are not\\ndiagnoses in the DSM-5-TR, but are alternative terms used to describe learning disorders in reading\\n(dyslexia) and math (dyscalculia). Dyslexia refers to a pattern of learning difficulties characterized by\\nproblems with accurate or fluent word recognition, decoding, and spelling (APA, 2022). Dyscalculia\\nrefers to a pattern of learning difficulties characterized by “problems processing numerical information,\\nlearning arithmetic facts, and performing accurate or fluent calculations” (APA, 2022, pg. 78).\\nAlthough these two terms are used very frequently in school systems and by professionals such as\\nSpeech/Language Pathologists, they are not diagnoses and are considered alternative terms in the\\nDSM-5-TR. Instead, a mental health professional will diagnose a specific learning disorder with\\nimpairment in reading (for dyslexia) and a specific learning disorder with impairment in mathematics\\n(for dyscalculia). This is an excellent example of how professionals will sometimes discuss the same\\nphenomenon but use different terminology.\\nDifferences and Similarities between the Disorders\\nAlthough intellectual developmental disorder and specific learning disorder may seem very similar, it is\\nimportant not to confuse the two, as they are different. When thinking about both disorders, we have\\nthree distinct core areas to consider: adaptive functioning, cognitive/intellectual ability (IQ), and\\nacademic achievement. A rudimentarily way to think about this is with intellectual developmental\\ndisorder we are concerned with adaptive functioning and IQ, and with specific learning disorder we are\\nconcerned with IQ (sort of) and academic achievement. Although IQ matters (sort of) in both disorders,'),\n",

Because IQ is considered in both disorders, people often\\nintertwine and confuse the two.\\nLet’s take a minute and think about this: IQ is what we are cognitively able to do – what we can do.\\nAdaptive skills and academic achievement refer to what we are doing.\\nIntellectual developmental disorder. If we cannot perform in the average range on an IQ test and we\\nare not performing daily living tasks appropriately (for our chronological age –we would not expect a 7-\\nyear-old to make their own doctor’s appointment but would expect them to know to dial 911 in an\\nemergency), then this is indicative of intellectual developmental disorder (intellectual disability).\\nSpecific learning disorder. To differentiate between a specific learning disorder and intellectual\\ndevelopmental disorder, it is useful to consider the discrepancy between what is expected of an\\nindividual (what they can do) and what they are doing. If an individual cannot perform averagely\\nbecause their IQ is substantially below average, we could not expect them to perform at an average\\nlevel on academic tasks. For example, if a person’s IQ is 70 and they cannot function typically on\\ncognitive tasks, we would not expect them to achieve an academic score of 100, a 30-point jump from\\nwhat they can do to what they are doing. If an individual has an IQ of 70, we would expect their\\nacademic score to be around 70, which would not necessarily indicate a specific learning disorder, even\\nthough the score is low. In this case, they would be performing as expected, so the low score\\nachievement score would reflect low cognitive abilities resulting from intellectual development\\ndisorder. However, if there is a large discrepancy between what a person can do and what they are\\ndoing, for example, someone with an IQ of 100 scoring only a 70 in an academic achievement task, this\\ncould indicate a specific learning disorder.\\n \\n     16.2.2.2. Prevalence. Specific learning disorder occurs in approximately 5 to 15% of school-age\\nchildren in Brazil, Northern Ireland, and the United States. It is more common in males than females\\nand suicidal thoughts and behavior were found in U.S. adolescents aged 15 years in public school\\npresenting with poor reading ability (APA, 2022).\\n     16.2.2.3. Comorbidity. The different types of specific learning disorder are comorbid with one\\nanother (i.e., impairment in mathematics with reading), other neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g.,\\nADHD, ASD, developmental coordination disorder, and communication disorders), anxiety disorders,\\nbehavioral problems, and depressive disorders.\\n     16.2.2.4. Onset. Onset, recognition, and diagnosis of specific learning disorder typically occur\\nduring the elementary school years as this is when children are required to read, spell, write, and learn\\nmathematics. During early childhood and before the child starts school, there may be warning signs to\\ninclude delays or deficits in language, problems with rhyming or counting, and issues related to fine\\nmotor skills needed for writing. Specific learning disorder is lifelong, though an individual may\\nexperience a persistent shifting array of learning difficulties across the lifespan. According to APA\\n(2022), negative functional consequences occur across the lifespan and can include, “…lower academic\\nattainment, higher rates of high school dropout, lower rates of postsecondary education, high levels of\\npsychological distress and poorer overall mental health, higher rates of unemployment and\\nunderemployment, and lower incomes” (DSM-5-TR, pg. 84).'),\n",

For example, children that\\nare gifted, but have a reading disorder, often go undiagnosed because their deficits look like average\\nabilities to others. Here is an example to illustrate this:\\nA 2nd grader with a high cognitive ability earns all As. She excels in math and writing. In fact, she is far\\npast her peers in these areas. She has long learned her multiplication and division facts and is even\\nworking on some basic geometry skills. She can write and has been drafting paragraphs with ease and\\nhas even started learning to write essays. She loves math and writing, but she dislikes reading. When in\\nclass, she reads just like her peers, no more advanced, but right on 2nd grade level expectations. She\\nfinds reading to be more difficult, though, and it doesn’t come nearly as easy as math and writing.\\nHowever, because she is on track compared to her peers, her teachers and parents do not recognize\\nany issues – her grades are fine and her school standardized testing is not a problem.\\nWhat if you learned that her standardized math and writing scores matched her intellectual ability\\n(meaning her can do and is doing matched) but her reading score (is doing), although average, is well\\nbelow what would be expected given her IQ (can do) and is much lower than her math and writing\\nscores, despite still being an acceptable score? Would you say she may have a reading disorder? If you\\nsaid yes, you are right. If you said no, you may be right too. The fact is, this is a gray area. Previous\\nversions of the DSM would have made it easy to diagnose this child with a learning disorder in reading.\\nThe DSM-5-TR makes it a bit tougher. If this reading deficit, compared to her own abilities, caused\\napparent impairment (internal distress, preventing her from advancing in math and writing because her\\nreading abilities were lagging behind her other abilities), one would be inclined to diagnose her with a\\nspecific learning disorder in reading. However, one can see how this child could be overlooked and\\nundiagnosed for years.\\nNow let’s reverse the scenario. A 2nd grade girl has a diagnosis of an intellectual developmental\\ndisorder (intellectual disability). She struggles in all areas of academics. However, her math abilities\\nare even more behind than her reading and writing. Do you think one could make a case for a specific\\nlearning disorder in math? Theoretically, they could. But it takes a lot of careful documentation of\\nintervention attempts (see RTI discussion) and standardized testing that makes it undoubtedly clear\\nthat this is true (similar to the above example).\\nWhen an individual has an IQ that lands in an extreme (low or high), their weaknesses are often missed.\\nAs such, providers and educators must be careful not overlook potential specific learning disorders in\\nthese individuals.\\n \\nFor more on intellectual developmental and specific learning disorders please visit:\\nhttps://opentext.wsu.edu/behavioral-disorders-childhood/chapter/module-7-intellectual-disability-intellec\\ntual-developmental-disorder-ididd-learning-disorders/'),\n",

Autism Spectrum Disorder\\n     16.2.3.1. Clinical Presentation. The essential features of ASD are twofold and include persistent\\nimpairment in reciprocal social communication and social interaction (Criterion A) and restricted,\\nrepetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities (Criterion B). It is described as a spectrum\\nbecause of the varying manifestations of the disorder due to severity of the autistic condition,\\ndevelopmental level, chronological level, and gender (APA, 2022).\\n     16.2.3.1.1. Criterion A: Social communication and social interaction. The child must present\\nwith all of the following symptoms. These include behaviors such as poor eye contact, dominating a\\nconversation/or lacking ability to maintain conversation due to absent or limited reciprocity (i.e., “to\\nand fro” conversation in the exchange of information), trouble with integrating verbal communication\\nwith nonverbal communication (e.g., for example using gestures, body language, or visual guiding), and\\nstruggles with maintaining friendships or relationships in general. Individuals with these difficulties\\nhave trouble understanding others’ perspectives, reading emotions, and inferring minor and subtle\\nsocial cues.\\n     16.2.3.1.2. Criterion B: Restricted and repetitive behaviors, interests, or activities.  The\\nchild must present with at least two of the following. First, they engage in stereotyped movement,\\nfrequently called stereotypy, such as hand flapping, spinning, or any repetitive movement that does not\\nhave an obvious function. They might display restricted or repetitive play such as lining up toys or\\nfixating on a part of a toy or button. Individuals may have excessive and restricted interests such as\\nbeing overly interested in history, dinosaurs, robotics, etc. Their interests may be so intense that, if\\ndiscussing their interests, it is difficult to get them to move on to a new topic, or it may be the only\\nthing about which they will engage in a conversation.\\nRestricted behaviors might include strict adherence to routines or schedules. Individuals may become\\nvery dysregulated if there is a new routine introduced or their routine is changed in any way. Moreover,\\nsensory concerns may be of particular relevance. Some individuals may seek out sensory stimulation\\n(sensory seeking behavior which is often referred to as “stimming”) as a soothing method. In fact, many\\nrepetitive movements can be seen as sensory stimulating. Examples, although not an exhaustive list, of\\n“stimming” may include rubbing hands on a rough material repetitively (tactile), putting objects on\\ntheir mouth/lips (oral), grunting or making nonfunctional vocalizations (vocal), or looking at lights or\\nvisual lines in odd ways (visual). Others may avoid certain sensory input which is known as a sensory\\naversion. For example, being very averse to certain textures, heightened sensitivity to pitch or volume\\nof noise, or bright lights.\\n     16.2.3.2. Diagnosing ASD. Individuals must exhibit both social communication concerns and\\nrestricted/repetitive behaviors/interests/activities to be diagnosed with ASD. Furthermore, these\\nsymptoms must have been present very early in development (APA, 2022).\\nAlthough language delays are common in children with ASD, they are not necessarily required.\\nMoreover, there is often a misconception that if a child has severe ASD, they are nonverbal, meaning\\nthey do not have language. This is not accurate. Children with ASD present very differently from each\\nother. Regarding ASD, Dr. Stephen Shore said, “If you’ve met one person with autism, you’ve met one\\nperson with autism.” In other words, one child with ASD may have symptoms that present very\\ndifferently from another child with ASD, but both children have ASD.\\n     16.2.3.3.

As such, clinicians will assign\\nspecifiers that identify if there is any evidence of language impairment or intellectual impairment. For\\nintellectual impairment, separate estimates of verbal and nonverbal skill are necessary. For language\\nimpairment, the clinician should consider receptive and expressive language skills separately since\\nreceptive may lag behind expressive language development in ASD.\\nMoreover, ASD is diagnosed in the context of current severity for both social communication\\nimpairments and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. The clinician will\\nassign a severity level to each of the two main criteria indicating how much support the individual\\nneeds. Level 3 indicates “Requiring very substantial support,” Level 2 means “Requiring substantial\\nsupport, and Level 1 states, “Requiring support.”\\n     16.2.3.4. Associated features. Intellectual and/or language impairment is common in many\\nindividuals with ASD. They may have difficulty seeing the world from another person’s perspective,\\ncalled a theory-of-mind deficit. Motor deficits are also present and can include odd gait, being clumsy,\\nand walking on tiptoes. Self-injury such as banging one’s head or biting one’s wrist are also common.\\n     16.2.3.5. Development and course. The behavioral features of ASD first become noticeable in\\nearly childhood as some children will present with a lack of interest in social interaction during their\\nfirst year of life. For children in which skills have been lost, parents and other caregivers may provide a\\nhistory showing gradual or relatively rapid deterioration in social behaviors or language skills occurring\\nbetween 12 and 24 months.\\nIn terms of symptoms, the first symptoms of ASD typically involve delayed language development, often\\naccompanied by lack of social interest or unusual social interactions, odd play patterns such as carrying\\na toy around but never playing with it, and unusual communication patterns such as knowing the\\nalphabet but not responding when their name is said. During the second year, odd and repetitive\\nbehaviors, and the absence of typical play become more apparent (APA, 2022).\\n     16.2.3.6. Prevalence. ASD has been reported in 1% to 2% of the U.S. population. Prevalence is\\nlower among African American (1.1%) and Latinx (0.8%) children compared to Caucasian children\\n(1.3%). In non-U.S. countries prevalence has approached 1% of the population. The male:female ratio\\nglobally is 3:1. Individuals with ASD are at greater risk for suicide death and children with ASD who\\nhad impaired social communication had a higher risk for self-harm with suicidal intent, suicidal\\nthoughts, and suicide plans by age 16 compared to those without the impaired social communication\\n(APA, 2022).\\n     16.2.3.7. Comorbidity. Comorbid disorders are very common for children with autism. Specifically,\\n70% of children with autism have a comorbid diagnosis. Further, 40% of children with autism have two\\nor more additional disorders. ASD is comorbid with intellectual developmental disorder and language\\ndisorder, specific learning difficulties, anxiety disorders, depression, ADHD, and avoidant/restrictive\\nfood intake disorder.\\n \\n16.2.4.

To receive a diagnosis, all of the\\nfollowing must be present: 1) problems with using communication for social purposes such as greeting\\nor exchanging information, 2) difficulty with changing communication to match context or needs of the\\nlistener such as recognizing that one speaks softer in a classroom but louder at a football game, 3)\\ndifficultly following the rules for conversation or storytelling such as understanding that individuals\\nengaged in a conversation take turns speaking, and 4) problems understanding what is not explicitly\\nstated and nonliteral or ambiguous meanings of language such as idioms, humor, or metaphors.\\nAlthough, in many ways this may seem very similar to ASD, one of the biggest differences is that\\nrestricted or repetitive behaviors/interests are not present. It should be noted that, as individuals with\\nASD age, restricted/repetitive behaviors tend to decline. If this occurs, but the individual had a history\\nof the restricted/repetitive behaviors, they are still diagnosed with ASD, even if those behaviors are not\\ncurrently present, rather than social (pragmatic) communication disorder.\\n     16.2.4.2. Development and course. Social (pragmatic) communication disorder is not typically\\ndiagnosed in children under four years of age.

Whether efforts to stop such movements are successful is\\nquestionable. For children that are developing typically, directing attention to the movements, or\\ndistracting them from performing the movements, are successful. For children with\\nneurodevelopmental disorders, such efforts are less successful. The behavior displayed varies, but each\\nchild has their own signature or individually patterned behavior. Duration of the behavior is a few\\nseconds to several minutes or longer, while the frequency can vary from many occurrences during a\\nsingle day, to several weeks between episodes. The behaviors can occur during moments of boredom,\\nexcitement, stress, fatigue, or when the child is engrossed in other activities.\\nThe stereotypic movements cause impairment in social, academic, or other activities and can result in\\nself-injury. In fact, the mental health professional should specify if stereotypic movement disorder is\\nwith or without self-injurious behavior and whether the severity of the disorder is mild, moderate, or\\nsevere. A mild presentation is one in which the stereotypic movement is easily suppressed by a sensory\\nstimulus or distraction. Severe presentation would be characterized by continuous movements that\\ninterfere with daily living. The onset of the disorder is during the early developmental period, typically\\nwithin the first three years of life (APA, 2022).\\n     16.2.5.2. Prevalence. Stereotypic movement disorder is relatively rare, occurring in only about 3\\nto 4% of the general population. However, in individuals with intellectual developmental disorder\\n(intellectual disability), the prevalence rate is higher and occurs in about 4 to 16% of individuals. The\\nrisk is greater in individuals with severe intellectual developmental disorder.\\n     16.2.5.3. Comorbidity. Stereotypic movement disorder is often comorbid with other genetic and\\nbiologically based disorders such fragile X syndrome, Rett syndrome, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, as well as\\nother related conditions (Oliver, Petty, Ruddick, & Bacarese-Hamilton, 2012). Additionally, the disorder\\nis comorbid with ADHD, motor coordination problems, tics/Tourette’s disorder, and anxiety (APA, 2022).\\n     16.2.5.4. Differential diagnosis: Autism spectrum disorder. Although the repetitive movements\\nof stereotypic movement disorder may be reminiscent of behaviors seen in children with autism and\\nmay develop in the same developmental timeframe (e.g., around or before age 3) as autism spectrum\\ndisorder, children with stereotypic movement disorder do not display social communication and\\nreciprocity deficits. Moreover, they do not have circumscribed interests, difficulty with transitions,\\ndelayed speech, etc. The only displayed symptom related to autism spectrum disorder is the stereotypy\\nrelated to behavior. As the DSM says, “When autism spectrum disorder is present, stereotypic\\nmovement disorder is diagnosed only when there is self-injury or when the stereotypic behaviors are\\nsufficiently severe to become a focus of treatment” (APA, 2022, pg. 91).\\n     16.2.5.5. Differential diagnosis: Tic disorders. It may seem that distinguishing between a tic\\nand stereotyped movement would be difficult. However, there are a few factors that help differentiate\\nthe two. For example, tics tend to be variable, meaning they change over time. Stereotyped movements,\\nalthough they may change, tend to be more fixed and consistent. Moreover, stereotyped movements\\nrelated to stereotypic movement disorder tend to present earlier in development (before age 3) than tics\\nrelated to tic disorders do (mean age at onset 4-6 years). Finally, tics are typically quick, brief, and\\nfleeting, whereas stereotypic movements tend to be more prolonged and repetitive (APA, 2022).\\n     16.2.5.6. Differential diagnosis: OCD. The absence of obsessions in stereotypic movement\\ndisorder distinguishes it from obsessive-compulsive disorder. As the DSM says, “In OCD the individual\\nfeels driven to perform repetitive behaviors in response to an obsession or according to rules that must'),\n",

However, in trichotillomania\\nand excoriation, there tends to be a purpose for the behavior (e.g., extreme anxiety) and the behavior is\\nnot typically patterned or displayed in a rhythmic way. Whereas, in stereotypic movement disorder, the\\nbehaviors are more patterned or rhythmic. Stereotypic movement disorder has an earlier onset than\\nOCD-related disorders, which tends to be around puberty or later (APA, 2022).\\n \\n16.2.6. Tic Disorders\\n     16.2.6.1. Clinical Presentation. Tic disorders consist of three separate diagnoses. The most\\ncommonly known of the three is Tourette’s disorder. The second diagnosis is persistent (chronic) motor\\nor vocal tic disorder. The third is provisional tic disorder. We will start by discussing the tic disorders\\ngenerally and then move to specifics of each.\\n     16.2.6.1.1. General symptoms. These disorders present before adulthood (i.e., 18 years old).\\nTypically speaking, the time in which they present is between the ages of 4 and 6 and are most severe\\nin symptomology between the ages of 10 and 12.\\nFor all three disorders, tics are present. The DSM defines a tic as, “a sudden, rapid, recurrent,\\nnonrhythmic motor movement or vocalization (APA, 2022, pg. 93).  Tics can be either motor movements\\n(motor) or vocalizations (vocal). These can be simple, meaning they only involve one movement or\\nvocalization, or they can be complex, meaning they involve multiple movements, vocalizations, or a\\ncombination of movements and vocalizations within the same tic. Tics are largely considered to be\\ninvoluntary. It is common for tics to increase in severity for a period of time and then resolve or\\ndrastically reduce for a period of time (APA, 2022).\\n     16.2.6.1.2. Tourette’s disorder. Tourette’s disorder occurs when both motor and vocal tics are\\npresent. More than one motor tic must be present and at least one vocal tic must occur (APA, 2022) to\\nbe classified as Tourette’s disorder. The tics do not have to occur together and do not have to be\\ncomplex tics. Though tics may increase and decrease in frequency, they will have persisted for more\\nthan one year since the first tic onset.\\n     16.2.6.1.3. Persistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder. This is when either one or more\\nmotor tic or one or more vocal tic is present. However, vocal and motor tics are not both present (APA,\\n2022). These again can be simple or complex and only the presence of one tic is required. To receive\\nthis diagnosis, the individual must never have been diagnosed with Tourette’s disorder. The mental\\nhealth professional will specify whether the disorder presents with motor tics only or with vocal tics\\nonly, and though tics may increase and decrease in frequency, they will have persisted for more than\\none year since first tic onset.\\n     16.2.6.1.4. Provisional tic disorder. This diagnosis is used if there are single or multiple motor\\nand/or vocal tics, but they have been present for less than one year since first tic onset. The criteria for\\nTourette’s disorder or persistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder will never have been met.'),\n",

Differential Diagnosis. In terms of differential diagnosis, tic disorders must be\\ndistinguished from OCD and related disorders.

Essentially, an individual’s ability to\\nregulate their cognitions, emotions, and behaviors, are impaired. Individuals may lose things frequently,\\ntalk excessively, forget assignments/appointments, fidget frequently, move constantly, get distracted,\\nand struggle with organization. Symptoms also are required to be present in more than one setting. For\\nexample, if symptoms are only present at school, an individual would not be diagnosed with ADHD.\\nSymptoms are generally organized into two main categories: hyperactivity and impulsivity symptoms\\nand inattention symptoms. An individual receives a diagnosis of ADHD with the needed specifier if there\\nare: 1) at least six symptoms of inattention for this specifier, 2) at least six symptoms of hyperactivity\\nand impulsivity for this specifier, or 3) six of each of the preceding two for the combined specifier (APA,\\n2022). The exact symptoms an individual may experience are described below.\\n     16.3.1.1.1. Inattentive symptoms (A1). Children who are inattentive tend to lose things\\nnecessary for tasks or activities, do not listen when spoken to directly, do not follow through on\\ninstructions and fail to finish tasks, do not give close attention to details or make careless mistakes, and\\nare easily distracted by extraneous stimuli. They also are forgetful in daily activities; avoids, dislikes, or\\nare reluctant to partake of activities requiring sustained mental effort; fail to sustain attention in tasks\\nor play activities; and have problems organizing tasks and activities. Of these 9 symptoms, 6 or more\\nmust be displayed to receive the specifier and should have occurred for the past six months (APA,\\n2022).\\n     16.3.1.1.2. Hyperactivity and impulsivity symptoms (A2). These symptoms are related to\\nexcessive energy and movement as well as impulsivity. Individuals with these symptoms are often\\ndescribed as high energy or “on the go,” talkative, and fidgety. These children may have a hard time\\nwaiting their turn, standing still, remaining in their seat, or engaging in leisure activities quietly. They\\nblurt out answers before the question has been completed and often interrupt or intrude on others. Of\\nthese 9 symptoms, 6 or more must be displayed to receive the specifier and should have occurred for\\nthe past six months (APA, 2022).\\n     16.3.1.1.3. Combined presentation. To receive the combined presentation specifier, an individual\\nmust display at least six inattention symptoms and six hyperactivity and impulsivity symptoms for the\\npast six months (APA, 2022).\\n     16.3.1.2. Associated features. Individuals with ADHD (any specifier) display emotional\\ndysregulation or emotional impulsivity, are often quick to anger, easily frustrated, and overreact\\nemotionally. They may exhibit neurocognitive deficits and often show delays in language, motor, or\\nsocial development.\\n     16.3.1.3. Development and course. Excessive motor activity is often observed by parents when\\nthe child is a toddler but, “…symptoms are difficult to distinguish from highly variable normative\\nbehavior before age 4 years” (APA, 2022, pg. 71). In preschool, hyperactivity is most common. ADHD is\\nmost often identified during the elementary school years as the inattention becomes more prominent\\nand impairing. Hyperactivity becomes less prominent during adolescence and is confined to being\\nfidgety, restless, or impatient. In adulthood, impulsivity, inattention, and restlessness may remain\\nproblematic, even if hyperactivity has diminished.\\n     16.3.1.4. Prevalence. ADHD occurs in about 7.2% of children worldwide, with cross-national'),\n",

ADHD is more often\\ndiagnosed in males than in females. Females are more likely to present primarily with inattentive\\nfeatures. Because predominantly inattentive symptoms are not as disruptive and noticeable as\\nhyperactive/impulsive symptoms, predominantly inattentive presentations of ADHD may go\\nundiagnosed or be diagnosed much later than ADHD predominantly hyperactive/impulsive or combined\\npresentations. Finally, ADHD is a risk factor for suicidal ideation and behavior in children (APA, 2022).\\n     16.3.1.5. Comorbidity. According to the CDC, approximately 60% of children with ADHD have\\nanother comorbid disorder (CDC, 2018a, September). About 50% of children with ADHD combined\\npresentation, and about 25% of children with ADHD predominantly inattentive presentation, are also\\ndiagnosed with Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD). Conduct Disorder is also highly comorbid with\\nADHD (i.e., about 25% of youth with ADHD combined presentation) and most children and adolescents\\nwith disruptive mood dysregulation disorder have symptoms that also meet the criteria for ADHD (APA,\\n2022).\\nLearning disorders are also commonly comorbid with ADHD. However, differentiating if a learning\\ndisorder is present, in addition to ADHD, requires thorough evaluation (see differential discussion\\nbelow).\\nMood and anxiety disorders, as well as OCD and intermittent explosive disorder, are less likely to be\\ncomorbid than other behavioral disorders (CDC, 2018a, September). However, they do occur at a higher\\nrate in children with ADHD compared to children without ADHD (APA, 2022). Many individuals with\\nADHD report daytime sleepiness that could meet criteria for hypersomnolence disorder.\\n     16.3.1.6. Differential Diagnosis. ADHD should be distinguished from the following disorders:\\n     16.3.1.6.1. ODD. Because inattention and impulsivity can lead to noncompliance with rules,\\npsychologists need to carefully assess behaviors and differentiate between ADHD and ODD. For\\nexample, a child may be told to clean their room. A child with ADHD may (1) not hear or fully attend to\\nthe instruction and then not comply or (2) may hear the instruction, begin to clean their room, get\\ndistracted mid-way, and start playing with a toy they found, perhaps impulsively, while they are\\nsupposed to be cleaning. Although noncompliant with the command, they are not actively being defiant.\\nA child with ODD may be told to clean their room, and rather than comply, may actively defy the\\ncommand. Because symptoms of ADHD can lead to a higher risk of noncompliance, we must be careful\\nto not misperceive noncompliance with defiance. However, both can occur together (see comorbidity\\nsection above), and as such, when both are present, both will be diagnosed.\\n     16.3.1.6.2. Anxiety. Anxiety can lead to difficulty with concentration, fidgeting, and distractibility,\\nwhich overlap with some symptoms of ADHD. It is not uncommon for a child to be referred for concerns\\nrelated to ADHD, especially ADHD predominantly inattentive presentation, but may, in fact, be\\nexperiencing anxiety instead. Bear in mind that the inattention in anxiety disorders may be attributable\\nto worry and rumination. Differential diagnosis of anxiety versus ADHD is important because treatment\\nfor the two disorders is different.\\n     16.3.1.6.3. Learning disorders. Because symptoms of ADHD can impair school performance and\\nlearning, psychologists must differentiate between (1) general impairment in learning due to\\ninattentive, impulsiveness, etc. or (2) a specific impairment in an identified learning area (i.e., math,\\nreading, written expression).'),\n",

Oppositional defiant disorder is characterized by a child that is\\ndefiant/argumentative, angry/irritable, and vindictive, and has shown this pattern of behavior for at\\nleast six months. Of the eight possible symptoms, the child must present with at least four of them. In\\nterms of angry/irritable mood, they may lose their temper often, are easily annoyed or touchy, and are\\noften angry and resentful. In terms of argumentative/defiant behavior the child argues with authority\\nfigures, actively defies or refuses to comply, deliberately annoys others, or blames others for their\\nmistakes. Finally, they must have acted spiteful or vindictive at least twice within the past six months.\\nDistress occurs in the child’s immediate social context or affects social, occupational, educational, or\\nother important areas of functioning. Functional consequences of these behaviors include frequent\\nconflicts with parents, teachers, supervisors, peers, and romantic partners (APA, 2022). The disorder\\ntypically appears during the preschool years and rarely later than early adolescence.\\n     16.3.2.2. Prevalence. According to the DSM-5-TR, the cross-national prevalence of oppositional\\ndefiant disorder ranges from 1% to 11% with an average prevalence estimate of around 3.3%. The\\ndisorder is more common in boys than girls prior to adolescence (APA, 2022).\\n     16.3.2.3. Comorbidity.

The DSM says, “Temporal association with\\na stressor and symptom duration of less than 6 months after the resolution of the stressor may help\\ndistinguish adjustment disorder from oppositional defiant disorder” (APA, 2022).\\n \\n16.3.3. Conduct Disorder\\n     16.3.3.1. Clinical Presentation. Conduct disorder is a more severe behavioral disorder in which\\nan individual displays a disregard, not only for rules and authority, but also the rights and conditions of\\nhumans and/or animals. Behaviors that may be exhibited are stealing, fighting, cruelty to people or\\nanimals, fire-setting, running away from home, bullying or threatening others, using a weapon that can\\ncause harm, committing a mugging or armed robbery, forcing someone into sexual activity, deliberately\\ndestroying another person’s property, lying to obtain goods or favors, stealing items of nontrivial value\\nwithout confronting the victim, staying out at night in clear violation of parental rules, and being truant\\nfrom school. The preceding represents 15 symptoms of which the person must present with at least\\nthree in the past 12 months, with at least one criterion present in the past 6 months.\\nThere are three subtypes of conduct disorder focused on the age of onset. The childhood-onset type\\noccurs prior to age 10 while the adolescence-onset type occurs after age 10. The unspecified onset\\nsubtype is used when age of onset is unknown. Males usually receive the childhood-onset subtype and\\nhave disturbed peer relationships, likely were diagnosed with oppositional defiant disorder in early\\nchildhood, and typically have symptoms that meet full criteria for conduct disorder before puberty.\\nConduct disorder is often associated with limited prosocial emotions. To qualify for this specifier, at\\nleast two of the following characteristics must have been displayed persistently over the past 12 months\\nand in multiple relationships and settings. These include: a lack of remorse or guilt, a lack of concern\\nfor the feelings of others (callous – lack of empathy), being unconcerned about performance, and having\\nshallow or deficient affect.\\nFunctional consequences of these behaviors include being suspended or expulsed from school,\\nproblems in work adjustment, legal problems, sexually transmitted diseases, physical injury from\\naccidents or fights, and unplanned pregnancy. It is also associated with early onset of sexual behavior;\\nalcohol, tobacco, and illegal substances use; and reckless and risk-taking behaviors.\\nThe onset of conduct disorder occurs as early as the preschool years, but it is during middle childhood\\nthrough middle adolescence that the first significant symptoms usually emerge. The DSM states,\\n“Physically aggressive symptoms are more common than nonaggressive symptoms during childhood,\\nbut nonaggressive symptoms become more common than aggressive symptoms during adolescence”\\n(APA, 2022, pg. 534).\\n     16.3.3.2. Prevalence. In the United States and other largely high-income countries, one-year\\npopulation prevalence estimates range from 2% to more than 10%, with a median of 4%. In the United\\nStates, the lifetime prevalence was 12% among men and 7.1% among women. For those with conduct\\ndisorder, suicidal thoughts, suicidal attempts, and suicide occur at a higher-than-expected rate.\\nIn relation to sex and gender-related diagnostic issues, girls and women diagnosed with conduct\\ndisorder are more likely to display lying, truancy, running away, and prostitution while boys and men\\nwith the disorder exhibit fighting, stealing, vandalism, and school discipline problems.

Other\\ncomorbid disorders include specific learning disorder, anxiety disorders, depressive or bipolar\\ndisorders, and substance-related disorders.\\n     16.3.3.4. Differential diagnosis. Conduct disorder and intermittent explosive disorder share the\\nfeature of high rates of aggression, but the aggression in intermittent explosive disorder is limited to\\nimpulsive aggression that is not premeditated and does not seek to accomplish an aim such as money,\\npower, or intimidation. Additionally, nonaggressive symptoms of conduct disorder are not present in\\nintermittent explosive disorder.\\n \\n16.3.4. Intermittent Explosive Disorder\\n     16.3.4.1. Clinical Presentation. Intermittent explosive disorder is characterized by recurrent\\nbehavioral outbursts which represent a failure to control aggressive impulses. It is manifested by one of\\nthe following: 1) verbal or physical aggression toward property, animals, or other individuals which\\noccur twice a week on average, for up to three months; and 2) “…three behavioral outbursts involving\\ndamage or destruction of property and/or physical assault involving physical injury against animals or\\nother individuals occurring within a 12-month period” (APA, 2022). The level of aggressiveness\\ndisplayed by the individual is out of proportion with the experienced provocation or stressors and is not\\nfor the purpose of achieving a tangible objective such as money, power, or intimidation. The disorder\\nshould not be diagnosed in individuals younger than 6 years.\\nFunctional consequences of these behaviors include loss of friends, relatives, or marital instability in the\\nsocial domain, demotion or loss of employment in the occupational domain, or civil suits due to the\\naggressive behavior against person or property in the legal domain. There could also be criminal\\ncharges and financial loss due to the destruction of objects.\\n     16.3.4.2. Prevalence. The 1-year prevalence in the United States is about 2.6% with a lifetime\\nprevalence of 4.0%. When intermittent explosive disorder is comorbid with PTSD, the rate of lifetime\\nsuicide attempts increases (41%; APA, 2022).\\n     16.3.2.3. Comorbidity.

Anxiety Disorders – Selective Mutism\\n     16.4.1.1. Clinical Presentation. Selective mutism is characterized by an absence of speech in\\nparticular social situations in which a person is expected to speak, such as at school or work, despite\\nspeaking in other situations. This lack of speech is not due to a communication disorder; does not occur\\nexclusively during the course of autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, or another psychotic\\ndisorder; or due to a lack of knowledge of, or comfort with, the spoken language required in a specific\\nsocial situation (APA, 2022).  For example, a child with selective mutism may speak fluently and freely\\nwith a trusted caregiver in the privacy of their home (providing evidence that the child does not have a\\nspeech, language, or communication disorder) but produces no speech at school with peers or a\\nteacher. The disturbance must have lasted for at least one month and is often marked by high social\\nanxiety.             According to the DSM, associated features include, “excessive shyness, fear of social\\nembarrassment, social isolation and withdrawal, clinging, compulsive traits, negativism, temper\\ntantrums, or mild oppositional behavior” (APA, 2022, pg. 222). The onset of the disorder is usually\\nbefore 5 years but may not become apparent until entry into school.\\n     16.4.1.2. Prevalence. Selective mutism is relatively rare, occurring in only 0.03% to 1.9% of the\\npopulation and is more common in young children than adolescents and adults. There is conflicting\\nevidence about gender, with some studies/samples showing equal distribution and others showing a\\nhigher prevalence in girls. Prevalence does not vary by race/ethnicity.\\n     16.4.1.3. Comorbidity. Selective mutism is highly comorbid with other anxiety disorders,\\nparticularly social anxiety disorder followed by separation anxiety disorder and specific phobia.\\nCommunication disorders or delays also appear in some children with selective mutism (APA, 2022).\\n \\n16.4.2. Anxiety Disorders – Separation Anxiety Disorder\\n     16.4.2.1. Clinical Presentation. Separation anxiety disorder is characterized by excessive fear\\nor anxiety concerning being separated from those to whom the individual is attached. A child may worry\\nabout the caregiver becoming seriously ill, dying, or being permanently separated from them, and show\\npersistent and excessive fear of or reluctance about being alone or without this figure at home or other\\nsettings. They may refuse to go to school or other places and worry about experiencing an untoward\\nevent such as getting lost or being kidnapped that causes separation from a major attachment figure.\\nThey may refuse to sleep in their own bed or have recurring nightmares that involve separation from\\ntheir attachment figure. These children may also have several physical manifestations of the anxiety\\nincluding headaches and stomachaches when they are separated from, or anticipate separation from,\\nthe major attachment figure. This fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent and has lasted for at least\\nfour weeks in children and adolescents. For adults, it must last 6 months or more.'),\n",

These behaviors cause distress and impairment and may also\\nlead to other dermatological/medical conditions (APA, 2022).\\nHair pulling may be accompanied by a range of behaviors or rituals such as searching for a particular\\nkind of hair to pull such as those with a specific texture or color, pulling out hair in a specific way so\\nthat the root comes out intact, or visually examining or tactilely or orally manipulating the hair after it\\nis pulled out such as pulling the strand between the teeth. Pain does not routinely accompany hair\\npulling.\\nIt can be triggered by feelings of anxiety, boredom, and/or an increasing sense of tension, and may lead\\nto gratification, pleasure, or a sense of relief once the hair is pulled out. It has been noted that for some,\\nan “itch-like” or tingling sensation occurs and is alleviated once the hair has been pulled out. The act of\\nhair pulling does not usually occur in the presence of other people with the exception of immediate\\nfamily members. Some even have the urge to pull hair from other people or from pets, dolls, and other\\nfibrous materials (APA, 2022).\\nHair pulling can occur in infancy and will typically resolve during early development. Onset, though,\\nmost commonly coincides with, or follows, the onset of puberty. The usual course of trichotillomania is\\nchronic with waxing and waning of symptoms being typical if untreated. The disorder manifests\\nsimilarly across cultures and ethnic groups though there is not much data from non-Western regions.\\n     16.4.3.2. Prevalence. Trichotillomania occurs in 1% to 2% of adults and adolescents. Females are\\nmore often diagnosed with this disorder than males, in adulthood. However, in childhood, males and'),\n",

The most common comorbid disorders are MDD and excoriation disorder.\\nOther repetitive body-focused symptoms such as nail-biting occur in most individuals with\\ntrichotillomania and may warrant an additional diagnosis of other specified obsessive-compulsive and\\nrelated disorder (APA, 2022).\\n \\n16.4.4. Obsessive Compulsive and Related Disorders – Excoriation\\n     16.4.4.1. Clinical Presentation. Excoriation (Skin-Picking) disorder is similar to\\ntrichotillomania, except it involves skin-picking which results in skin lesions. Despite attempts to cease\\nthe behavior, the individual continues with it. The skin picking causes impairment and may also lead to\\nother medical consequences (APA, 2022).\\nSkin picking can be triggered by feelings of anxiety, boredom, and/or an increasing sense of tension,\\nand may lead to gratification, pleasure, or a sense of relief once the skin or scab has been picked. It\\ninvolves behaviors such as searching for a particular kind of scab to pull and examining, playing with, or\\nswallowing the skin after it has been pulled. The act of skin picking usually does not occur in the\\npresence of other people, except immediate family members, and some individuals report picking the\\nskin of others. Pain is not typically associated with skin picking (APA, 2022).\\nExcoriation disorder usually begins during adolescence, commonly with or following the onset of\\npuberty, and begins with a dermatological condition such as acne. The course is chronic with some\\nwaxing and waning if untreated. It appears clinical features are similar across cultures, though there is\\nlimited data currently.\\n     16.4.4.2. Prevalence. In terms of excoriation disorder, an online survey of over 10,000 adults\\nbetween the ages of 18-69 and gender-matched to the U.S. population found that 2.1% self-identified as\\nhaving current excoriation disorder while 3.1% reported lifetime excoriation disorder. Community\\nsamples show that 75% or more of individuals diagnosed with the disorder are women.\\n     16.4.4.3. Comorbidity. OCD, trichotillomania, and MDD are comorbid with excoriation disorder,\\nwith depression comorbidity being more common in women. Other repetitive body-focused symptoms\\nsuch as nail-biting occur in most individuals with excoriation disorder and may warrant an additional\\ndiagnosis of other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder (APA, 2022).\\n \\nFor more on trichotillomania and excoriation disorder please visit:\\nhttps://opentext.wsu.edu/behavioral-disorders-childhood/chapter/module-14-obsessive-compulsive-and-r\\nelated-disorders/\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:'),\n",

She was a successful student in high school,\\ngraduating valedictorian and obtaining a National Merit Scholarship for her performance on the PSAT\\nduring her junior year. She was accepted to a university on the opposite side of the state, where she\\nreceived additional scholarships giving her a free ride for her entire undergraduate education. Excited\\nto start this new chapter in her life, Cassie’s parents begin the 5-hour commute to Pullman, where they\\nwill leave their only daughter for the first time in her life.\\nThe semester begins as it always does in mid to late August. Cassie meets the challenge with\\nenthusiasm and does well in her classes for the first few weeks of the semester, as expected. Sometime\\naround Week 6, her friends notice she is despondent, detached, and falling behind in her work. After\\nbeing asked about her condition, she replies that she is “just a bit homesick,” and her friends accept\\nthis answer as it is a typical response to leaving home and starting college for many students. A month\\nlater, her condition has not improved but worsened. She now regularly shirks her responsibilities\\naround her apartment, in her classes, and on her job. Cassie does not hang out with friends like she did\\nwhen she first arrived for college and stays in bed most of the day. Concerned, Cassie’s friends contact\\nHealth and Wellness for help.\\nCassie’s story, though hypothetical, is true of many Freshmen leaving home for the first time to earn a\\nhigher education, whether in rural Washington state or urban areas such as Chicago and Dallas. Most\\nstudents recover from this depression and go on to be functional members of their collegiate\\nenvironment and accomplished scholars. Some students learn to cope on their own while others seek\\nassistance from their university’s health and wellness center or from friends who have already been\\nthrough the same ordeal. These are normal reactions. However, in cases like Cassie’s, the path to\\nrecovery is not as clear. Instead of learning how to cope, their depression increases until it reaches\\nclinical levels and becomes an impediment to success in multiple domains of life such as home, work,\\nschool, and social circles.\\nIn Module 1, we will explore what it means to display abnormal behavior, what mental disorders are,\\nand the way society views mental illness today and how it has been regarded throughout history. Then\\nwe will review research methods used by psychologists in general and how they are adapted to study\\nabnormal behavior/mental disorders. We will conclude with an overview of what mental health\\nprofessionals do.\\n \\nModule Outline\\n1.1. Understanding Abnormal Behavior\\n1.2. Classifying Mental Disorders\\n1.3.

Understanding Abnormal Behavior\\nTo understand what abnormal behavior is, we first have to understand what normal behavior is. Normal\\nreally is in the eye of the beholder, and most psychologists have found it easier to explain what is wrong\\nwith people then what is right. How so?\\nPsychology worked with the disease model for over 60 years, from about the late 1800s into the middle\\npart of the 20th century. The focus was simple – curing mental disorders – and included such pioneers\\nas Freud, Adler, Klein, Jung, and Erickson. These names are synonymous with the psychoanalytical\\nschool of thought. In the 1930s, behaviorism, under B.F. Skinner, presented a new view of human'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n18\\nbehavior. Simply, human behavior could be modified if the correct combination of reinforcements and\\npunishments were used. This viewpoint espoused the dominant worldview of the time – mechanism –\\nwhich presented the world as a great machine explained through the principles of physics and\\nchemistry. In it, human beings serve as smaller machines in the larger machine of the universe.\\nMoving into the mid to late 1900s, we developed a more scientific investigation of mental illness, which\\nallowed us to examine the roles of both nature and nurture and to develop drug and psychological\\ntreatments to “make miserable people less miserable.” Though this was an improvement, there were\\nthree consequences as pointed out by Martin Seligman in his 2008 TED Talk entitled, “The new era of\\npositive psychology.” These are:\\n“The first was moral; that psychologists and psychiatrists became victimologists, pathologizers;\\nthat our view of human nature was that if you were in trouble, bricks fell on you. And we forgot\\nthat people made choices and decisions. We forgot responsibility. That was the first cost.”\\n“The second cost was that we forgot about you people. We forgot about improving normal lives.\\nWe forgot about a mission to make relatively untroubled people happier, more fulfilled, more\\nproductive. And “genius,” “high-talent,” became a dirty word. No one works on that.”\\n“And the third problem about the disease model is, in our rush to do something about people in\\ntrouble, in our rush to do something about repairing damage, it never occurred to us to develop\\ninterventions to make people happier — positive interventions.”\\nStarting in the 1960s, figures such as Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers sought to overcome the\\nlimitations of psychoanalysis and behaviorism by establishing a “third force” psychology, also known as\\nhumanistic psychology. As Maslow said,\\n“The science of psychology has been far more successful on the negative than on the positive side; it\\nhas revealed to us much about man’s shortcomings, his illnesses, his sins, but little about his\\npotentialities, his virtues, his achievable aspirations, or his full psychological height. It is as if\\npsychology had voluntarily restricted itself to only half its rightful jurisdiction, and that the darker,\\nmeaner half.” (Maslow, 1954, p. 354).\\nHumanistic psychology instead addressed the full range of human functioning and focused on personal\\nfulfillment, valuing feelings over intellect, hedonism, a belief in human perfectibility, emphasis on the\\npresent, self-disclosure, self-actualization, positive regard, client centered therapy, and the hierarchy of\\nneeds. Again, these topics were in stark contrast to much of the work being done in the field of\\npsychology up to and at this time.\\nIn 1996, Martin Seligman became the president of the American Psychological Association (APA) and\\ncalled for a positive psychology or one that had a more positive conception of human potential and\\nnature. Building on Maslow and Roger’s work, he ushered in the scientific study of such topics as\\nhappiness, love, hope, optimism, life satisfaction, goal setting, leisure, and subjective well-being.\\nThough positive and humanistic psychology have similarities, their methodology was much different.\\nWhile humanistic psychology generally relied on qualitative methods, positive psychology utilizes a\\nquantitative approach and aims to help people make the most out of life’s setbacks, relate well to\\nothers, find fulfillment in creativity, and find lasting meaning and satisfaction\\n(https://www.positivepsychologyinstitute.com.au/what-is-positive-psychology).\\nSo, to understand what normal behavior is, do we look to positive psychology for an indication, or do we\\nfirst define abnormal behavior and then reverse engineer a definition of what normal is? Our preceding'),\n",

Possibly. The one truth is that no matter what\\nbehavior we display, if taken to the extreme, it can become disordered – whether trying to control\\nothers through social influence or helping people in an altruistic fashion. As such, we can consider\\nabnormal behavior to be a combination of personal distress, psychological dysfunction, deviance from\\nsocial norms, dangerousness to self and others, and costliness to society.\\n \\n1.1.2. How Do We Determine What Abnormal Behavior Is?\\nIn the previous section we showed that what we might consider normal behavior is difficult to define.\\nEqually challenging is understanding what abnormal behavior is, which may be surprising to you. A\\npublication which you will become intimately familiar with throughout this book, the American\\nPsychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th edition, Text\\nRevision (DSM-5-TR; 2022), states that, “Although no definition can capture all aspects of the range of\\ndisorders contained in DSM-5″ (pg. 13) certain aspects are required. These include:\\nDysfunction – Includes “clinically significant disturbance in an individual’s cognition, emotion\\nregulation, or behavior that reflects a dysfunction in the psychological, biological, or\\ndevelopmental processes underlying mental functioning” (pg. 14). Abnormal behavior, therefore,\\nhas the capacity to make well-being difficult to obtain and can be assessed by looking at an\\nindividual’s current performance and comparing it to what is expected in general or how the\\nperson has performed in the past. As such, a good employee who suddenly demonstrates poor\\nperformance may be experiencing an environmental demand leading to stress and ineffective\\ncoping mechanisms. Once the demand resolves itself, the person’s performance should return to\\nnormal according to this principle.\\nDistress – When the person experiences a disabling condition “in social, occupational, or other\\nimportant activities” (pg. 14). Distress can take the form of psychological or physical pain, or both\\nconcurrently. Alone though, distress is not sufficient enough to describe behavior as abnormal.\\nWhy is that? The loss of a loved one would cause even the most “normally” functioning individual\\npain. An athlete who experiences a career-ending injury would display distress as well. Suffering\\nis part of life and cannot be avoided. And some people who exhibit abnormal behavior are\\ngenerally positive while doing so.\\nDeviance – Closer examination of the word abnormal indicates a move away from what is normal,\\nor the mean (i.e., what would be considered average and in this case in relation to behavior), and\\nso is behavior that infrequently occurs (sort of an outlier in our data). Our culture, or the totality\\nof socially transmitted behaviors, customs, values, technology, attitudes, beliefs, art, and other\\nproducts that are particular to a group, determines what is normal. Thus, a person is said to be\\ndeviant when he or she fails to follow the stated and unstated rules of society, called social\\nnorms. Social norms change over time due to shifts in accepted values and expectations. For\\ninstance, homosexuality was taboo in the U.S. just a few decades ago, but today, it is generally\\naccepted. Likewise, PDAs, or public displays of affection, do not cause a second look by most\\npeople unlike the past when these outward expressions of love were restricted to the privacy of\\none’s own house or bedroom. In the U.S., crying is generally seen as a weakness for males.\\nHowever, if the behavior occurs in the context of a tragedy such as the Vegas mass shooting on\\nOctober 1, 2017, in which 58 people were killed and about 500 were wounded while attending the\\nRoute 91 Harvest Festival, then it is appropriate and understandable. Finally, consider that'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n20\\nstatistically deviant behavior is not necessarily negative. Genius is an example of behavior that is\\nnot the norm.\\nThough not part of the DSM conceptualization of what abnormal behavior is, many clinicians add\\ndangerousness to this list when behavior represents a threat to the safety of the person or others. It is\\nimportant to note that having a mental disorder does not imply a person is automatically dangerous.\\nThe depressed or anxious individual is often no more a threat than someone who is not depressed, and\\nas Hiday and Burns (2010) showed, dangerousness is more the exception than the rule.  Still, mental\\nhealth professionals have a duty to report to law enforcement when a mentally disordered individual\\nexpresses intent to harm another person or themselves. It is important to point out that people seen as\\ndangerous are also not automatically mentally ill.\\n \\n1.1.3. The Costs of Mental Illness\\nThis leads us to wonder what the cost of mental illness is to society. The National Alliance on Mental\\nIllness (NAMI) states that mental illness affects a person’s life which then ripples out to the family,\\ncommunity, and world. For instance, people with serious mental illness are at increased risk for\\ndiabetes, cancer, and cardiometabolic disease while 18% of those with a mental illness also have a\\nsubstance use disorder. Within the family, an estimated 8.4 million Americans provide care to an adult\\nwith an emotional or mental illness with caregivers spending about 32 hours a week providing unpaid\\ncare. At the community level 21% of the homeless also have a serious mental illness while 70% of youth\\nin the juvenile justice system have at least one mental health condition. And finally, depression is a\\nleading cause of disability worldwide and depression and anxiety disorders cost the global economy $1\\ntrillion each year in lost productivity (Source: NAMI, The Ripple Effect of Mental Illness infographic;\\nhttps://www.nami.org/Learn-More/Mental-Health-By-the-Numbers).\\nIn terms of worldwide impact, data from 2010 estimates $2.5 trillion in global costs, with $1.7 trillion\\nbeing indirect costs (i.e., invisible costs “associated with income losses due to mortality, disability, and\\ncare seeking, including lost production due to work absence or early retirement”) and the remainder\\nbeing direct (i.e., visible costs to include “medication, physician visits, psychotherapy sessions,\\nhospitalization,” etc.). It is now projected that mental illness costs will be around $16 trillion by 2030.\\nThe authors add, “It should be noted that these calculations did not include costs associated with\\nmental disorders from outside the healthcare system, such as legal costs caused by illicit drug abuse”\\n(Trautmann, Rehm, & Wittchen, 2016). The costs for mental illness have also been found to be greater\\nthan the combined costs of somatic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and respiratory disorders\\n(Whiteford et al., 2013).\\nChristensen et al. (2020) did a review of 143 cost-of-illness studies that covered 48 countries and\\nseveral types of mental illness. Their results showed that mental disorders are a substantial economic\\nburden for societies and that certain groups of mental disorders are more costly than others. At the\\nhigher cost end were developmental disorders to include autism spectrum disorders followed by\\nschizophrenia and intellectual disabilities. They write, “However, it is important to note that while\\ndisorders such as mood, neurotic and substance use disorders were less costly according to societal\\ncost per patient, these disorders are much more prevalent and thus would contribute substantially to\\nthe total national cost in a country.” And much like Trautmann, Rehm, & Wittchen (2016) other studies\\nshow that indirect costs are higher than direct costs (Jin & Mosweu, 2017; Chong et al., 2016).'),\n",

Defining Key Terms\\nOur discussion so far has concerned what normal and abnormal behavior is. We saw that the study of\\nnormal behavior falls under the providence of positive psychology. Similarly, the scientific study of\\nabnormal behavior, with the intent to be able to predict reliably, explain, diagnose, identify the causes\\nof, and treat maladaptive behavior, is what we refer to as abnormal psychology. Abnormal behavior\\ncan become pathological and has led to the scientific study of psychological disorders, or\\npsychopathology. From our previous discussion we can fashion the following definition of a\\npsychological or mental disorder: mental disorders are characterized by psychological dysfunction,\\nwhich causes physical and/or psychological distress or impaired functioning, and is not an expected\\nbehavior according to societal or cultural standards.\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nAbnormal behavior is a combination of personal distress, psychological dysfunction, deviance\\nfrom social norms, dangerousness to self and others, and costliness to society.\\nAbnormal psychology is the scientific study of abnormal behavior, with the intent to be able to\\npredict reliably, explain, diagnose, identify the causes of, and treat maladaptive behavior.\\nThe study of psychological disorders is called psychopathology.\\nMental disorders are characterized by psychological dysfunction, which causes physical and/or\\npsychological distress or impaired functioning, and is not an expected behavior according to\\nsocietal or cultural standards\\n \\nSection 1.1 Review Questions\\nWhat is the disease model and what problems existed with it?

Classification\\nClassification is not a foreign concept and as a student you have likely taken at least one biology class\\nthat discussed the taxonomic classification system of Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus,\\nand Species revolutionized by Swedish botanist, Carl Linnaeus.  You probably even learned a witty\\nmnemonic such as ‘King Phillip, Come Out For Goodness Sake’ to keep the order straight. The Library\\nof Congress uses classification to organize and arrange their book collections and includes such\\ncategories as B – Philosophy, Psychology, and Religion; H – Social Sciences; N – Fine Arts; Q – Science;\\nR – Medicine; and T – Technology.\\nSimply, classification is how we organize or categorize things. The second author’s wife has been\\nknown to color-code her Blu Ray collection by genre, movie title, and release date. It is useful for us to\\ndo the same with abnormal behavior, and classification provides us with a nomenclature, or naming\\nsystem, to structure our understanding of mental disorders in a meaningful way. Of course, we want to\\nlearn as much as we can about a given disorder so we can understand its cause, predict its future\\noccurrence, and develop ways to treat it.\\n \\n1.2.2. Determining Occurrence of a Disorder\\nEpidemiology is the scientific study of the frequency and causes of diseases and other health-related\\nstates in specific populations such as a school, neighborhood, a city, country, and the world.\\nPsychiatric or mental health epidemiology refers to the occurrence of mental disorders in a\\npopulation. In mental health facilities, we say that a patient presents with a specific problem, or the\\npresenting problem, and we give a clinical description of it, which includes information about the\\nthoughts, feelings, and behaviors that constitute that mental disorder. We also seek to gain information\\nabout the occurrence of the disorder, its cause, course, and treatment possibilities.\\nOccurrence can be investigated in several ways. First, prevalence is the percentage of people in a'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n23\\npopulation that has a mental disorder or can be viewed as the number of cases divided by the total\\nnumber of people in the sample. For instance, if 20 people out of 100 have bipolar disorder, then the\\nprevalence rate is 20%. Prevalence can be measured in several ways:\\nPoint prevalence indicates the proportion of a population that has the characteristic at a specific\\npoint in time. In other words, it is the number of active cases.\\nPeriod prevalence indicates the proportion of a population that has the characteristic at any\\npoint during a given period of time, typically the past year.\\nLifetime prevalence indicates the proportion of a population that has had the characteristic at\\nany time during their lives.\\nAccording to a 2020 infographic by the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), for U.S. adults, 1 in\\n5 experienced a mental illness, 1 in 20 had a serious mental illness, 1 in 15 experienced both a\\nsubstance use disorder and mental disorder, and over 12 million had serious thoughts of suicide (2020\\nMental Health By the Numbers: US Adults infographic). In terms of adolescents aged 12-17, in 2020 1\\nin 6 experienced a major depressive episode, 3 million had serious thoughts of suicide, and there was a\\n31% increase in mental health-related emergency department visits. Among U.S. young adults aged\\n18-25, 1 in 3 experienced a mental illness, 1 in 10 had a serious mental illness, and 3.8 had serious\\nthoughts of suicide (2020 Mental Health By the Numbers: Youth and Young Adults infographic). These\\nnumbers would represent period prevalence rates during the pandemic, and for the year 2020. In the,\\nYou are Not Alone infographic, NAMI reported the following 12-month prevalence rates for U.S. Adults:\\n19% having an anxiety disorder, 8% having depression, 4% having PTSD, 3% having bipolar disorder,\\nand 1% having schizophrenia.\\nSource: https://www.nami.org/mhstats\\n \\nIncidence indicates the number of new cases in a population over a specific period. This measure is\\nusually lower since it does not include existing cases as prevalence does. If you wish to know the\\nnumber of new cases of social phobia during the past year (going from say Aug 21, 2015 to Aug 20,\\n2016), you would only count cases that began during this time and ignore cases before the start date,\\neven if people are currently afflicted with the mental disorder. Incidence is often studied by medical and\\npublic health officials so that causes can be identified, and future cases prevented.\\nFinally, comorbidity describes when two or more mental disorders are occurring at the same time and\\nin the same person. The National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R) study conducted by the\\nNational Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and published in the June 6, 2005 issue of the Archives of\\nGeneral Psychiatry, sought to discover trends in prevalence, impairment, and service use during the\\n1990s. The first study, conducted from 1980 to 1985, surveyed 20,000 people from five different\\ngeographical regions in the U.S. A second study followed from 1990-1992 and was called the National\\nComorbidity Survey (NCS). The third study, the NCS-R, used a new nationally representative sample of\\nthe U.S. population, and found that 45% of those with one mental disorder met the diagnostic criteria\\nfor two or more disorders. The authors also found that the severity of mental illness, in terms of\\ndisability, is strongly related to comorbidity, and that substance use disorders often result from\\ndisorders such as anxiety and bipolar disorders. The implications of this are significant as services to\\ntreat substance abuse and mental disorders are often separate, despite the disorders appearing\\ntogether.'),\n",

Other Key Factors Related to Mental Disorders\\nThe etiology is the cause of the disorder. There may be social, biological, or psychological explanations\\nfor the disorder which need to be understood to identify the appropriate treatment. Likewise, the\\neffectiveness of a treatment may give some hint at the cause of the mental disorder. More on this in\\nModule 2.\\nThe course of the disorder is its particular pattern. A disorder may be acute, meaning that it lasts a\\nshort time, or chronic, meaning it persists for a long time. It can also be classified as time-limited,\\nmeaning that recovery will occur after some time regardless of whether any treatment occurs.\\nPrognosis is the anticipated course the mental disorder will take. A key factor in determining the\\ncourse is age, with some disorders presenting differently in childhood than adulthood.\\nFinally, we will discuss several treatment strategies in this book in relation to specific disorders, and in\\na general fashion in Module 3. Treatment is any procedure intended to modify abnormal behavior into\\nnormal behavior. The person suffering from the mental disorder seeks the assistance of a trained\\nprofessional to provide some degree of relief over a series of therapy sessions. The trained mental\\nhealth professional may prescribe medication or utilize psychotherapy to bring about this change.\\nTreatment may be sought from the primary care provider, in an outpatient facility, or through inpatient\\ncare or hospitalization at a mental hospital or psychiatric unit of a general hospital. According to NAMI,\\nthe average delay between symptom onset and treatment is 11 years with 45% of adults with mental\\nillness, 66% of adults with serious mental illness, and 51% of youth with a mental health condition\\nseeking treatment in a given year. They also report that 50% of white, 49% of lesbian/gay and bisexual,\\n43% of mixed/multiracial, 34% of Hispanic or Latinx, 33% of black, and 23% of Asian adults with a\\nmental health diagnosis received treatment or counseling in the past year (Source: Mental Health Care\\nMatters infographic, https://www.nami.org/mhstats).\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nClassification, or how we organize or categorize things, provides us with a nomenclature, or\\nnaming system, to structure our understanding of mental disorders in a meaningful way.\\nEpidemiology is the scientific study of the frequency and causes of diseases and other health-\\nrelated states in specific populations.\\nPrevalence is the percentage of people in a population that has a mental disorder or can be\\nviewed as the number of cases divided by the total number of people in the sample.\\nIncidence indicates the number of new cases in a population over a specific period.\\nComorbidity describes when two or more mental disorders are occurring at the same time and in\\nthe same person.\\nThe etiology is the cause of a disorder while the course is its particular pattern and can be acute,\\nchronic, or time-limited.\\nPrognosis is the anticipated course the mental disorder will take.'),\n",

The\\nproblem is that many people who need care never seek it out. Why is that?  We already know that\\nsociety dictates what is considered abnormal behavior through culture and social norms, and you can\\nlikely think of a few implications of that. But to fully understand society’s role in why people do not seek\\ncare, we need to determine the psychological processes underlying this phenomenon in the individual.\\nSocial cognition is the process through which we collect information from the world around us and\\nthen interpret it. The collection process occurs through what we know as sensation – or detecting\\nphysical energy emitted or reflected by physical objects. Detection occurs courtesy of our eyes, ears,\\nnose, skin and mouth; or via vision, hearing, smell, touch, and taste, respectfully. Once collected, the\\ninformation is relayed to the brain through the neural impulse where it is processed and interpreted, or\\nmeaning is added to this raw sensory data which we call perception.\\nOne way meaning is added is by taking the information we just detected and using it to assign people to\\ncategories, or groups. For each category, we have a schema, or a set of beliefs and expectations about'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n26\\na group of people, believed to apply to all members of the group, and based on experience. You might\\nthink of them as organized ways of making sense of experience. So, it is during our initial interaction\\nwith someone that we collect information about them, assign the person to a category for which we\\nhave a schema, and then use that to affect how we interact with them. First impressions, called the\\nprimacy effect, are important because even if we obtain new information that should override an\\nincorrect initial assessment, the initial impression is unlikely to change. We call this the perseverance\\neffect, or belief perseverance.\\nStereotypes are special types of schemas that are very simplistic, very strongly held, and not based on\\nfirsthand experience. They are heuristics, or mental shortcuts, that allow us to assess this collected\\ninformation very quickly. One piece of information, such as skin color, can be used to assign the person\\nto a schema for which we have a stereotype. This can affect how we think or feel about the person and\\nbehave toward them. Again, human beings tend to imply things about an individual solely due to a\\ndistinguishing feature and disregard anything inconsistent with the stereotype.\\nSocial identity theory (Tajfel, 1982; Turner, 1987) states that people categorize their social world into\\nmeaningfully simplistic representations of groups of people. These representations are then organized\\nas prototypes, or “fuzzy sets of a relatively limited number of category-defining features that not only\\ndefine one category but serve to distinguish it from other categories” (Foddy and Hogg, as cited in\\nFoddy et al., 1999). We construct in-groups and out-groups and categorize the self as an in-group\\nmember. The self is assimilated into the salient in-group prototype, which indicates what cognitions,\\naffect, and behavior we may exhibit. Stereotyping, out-group homogeneity, in-group/out-group bias,\\nnormative behavior, and conformity are all based on self-categorization.\\nHow so? Out-group homogeneity occurs when we see all members of an outside group as the same. This\\nleads to a tendency to show favoritism to, and exclude or hold a negative view of, members outside of,\\none’s immediate group, called the in-group/out-group bias. The negative view or set of beliefs about a\\ngroup of people is what we call prejudice, and this can result in acting in a way that is negative against\\na group of people, called discrimination. It should be noted that a person can be prejudicial without\\nbeing discriminatory since most people do not act on their attitudes toward others due to social norms\\nagainst such behavior. Likewise, a person or institution can be discriminatory without being prejudicial.\\nFor example, when a company requires that an applicant have a certain education level or be able to lift\\n80 pounds as part of typical job responsibilities. Individuals without a degree or ability to lift will be\\nremoved from consideration for the job, but this discriminatory act does not mean that the company has\\nnegative views of people without degrees or the inability to lift heavy weight. You might even hold a\\nnegative view of a specific group of people and not be aware of it. An attitude we are unaware of is\\ncalled an implicit attitude, which stands in contrast to explicit attitudes, which are the views within our\\nconscious awareness.\\nWe have spent quite a lot of space and time understanding how people gather information about the\\nworld and people around them, process this information, use it to make snap judgements about others,\\nform groups for which stereotypes may exist, and then potentially hold negative views of this group and\\nbehave negatively toward them as a result. Just one piece of information can be used to set this series of\\nmental events into motion. Outside of skin color, the label associated with having a mental disorder can\\nbe used. Stereotypes about people with a mental disorder can quickly and easily transform into\\nprejudice when people in a society determine the schema to be correct and form negative emotions and\\nevaluations of this group (Eagly & Chaiken, 1993). This, in turn, can lead to discriminatory practices\\nsuch as an employer refusing to hire, a landlord refusing to rent an apartment, or avoiding a romantic'),\n",

Stigma takes on\\nthree forms as described below:\\nPublic stigma – When members of a society endorse negative stereotypes of people with a mental\\ndisorder and discriminate against them. They might avoid them altogether, resulting in social\\nisolation. An example is when an employer intentionally does not hire a person because their\\nmental illness is discovered.\\nLabel avoidance –To avoid being labeled as “crazy” or “nuts” people needing care may avoid\\nseeking it altogether or stop care once started. Due to these labels, funding for mental health\\nservices could be restricted and instead, physical health services funded.\\nSelf-stigma – When people with mental illnesses internalize the negative stereotypes and\\nprejudice, and in turn, discriminate against themselves. They may experience shame, reduced\\nself-esteem, hopelessness, low self-efficacy, and a reduction in coping mechanisms. An obvious\\nconsequence of these potential outcomes is the why try effect, or the person saying ‘Why should I\\ntry and get that job? I am not worthy of it’ (Corrigan, Larson, & Rusch, 2009; Corrigan, et al.,\\n2016).\\nAnother form of stigma that is worth noting is that of courtesy stigma or when stigma affects people\\nassociated with a person who has a mental disorder. Karnieli-Miller et al. (2013) found that families of\\nthe afflicted were often blamed, rejected, or devalued when others learned that a family member had a\\nserious mental illness (SMI). Due to this, they felt hurt and betrayed, and an important source of social\\nsupport during a difficult time had disappeared, resulting in greater levels of stress. To cope, some\\nfamilies concealed their relative’s illness, and some parents struggled to decide whether it was their\\nplace to disclose their child’s condition. Others fought with the issue of confronting the stigma through\\nattempts at education versus just ignoring it due to not having enough energy or desiring to maintain\\npersonal boundaries. There was also a need to understand the responses of others and to attribute it to\\na lack of knowledge, experience, and/or media coverage. In some cases, the reappraisal allowed family\\nmembers to feel compassion for others rather than feeling put down or blamed. The authors concluded\\nthat each family “develops its own coping strategies which vary according to its personal experiences,\\nvalues, and extent of other commitments” and that “coping strategies families employ change over-\\ntime.”\\nOther effects of stigma include experiencing work-related discrimination resulting in higher levels of\\nself-stigma and stress (Rusch et al., 2014), higher rates of suicide especially when treatment is not\\navailable (Rusch, Zlati, Black, and Thornicroft, 2014; Rihmer & Kiss, 2002), and a decreased likelihood\\nof future help-seeking intention (Lally et al., 2013). The results of the latter study also showed that\\npersonal contact with someone with a history of mental illness led to a decreased likelihood of seeking\\nhelp. This is important because 48% of the university sample stated that they needed help for an\\nemotional or mental health issue during the past year but did not seek help. Similar results have been\\nreported in other studies (Eisenberg, Downs, Golberstein, & Zivin, 2009). It is also important to point\\nout that social distance, a result of stigma, has also been shown to increase throughout the life span,\\nsuggesting that anti-stigma campaigns should focus on older people primarily (Schomerus, et al., 2015).\\nOne potentially disturbing trend is that mental health professionals have been shown to hold negative\\nattitudes toward the people they serve. Hansson et al. (2011) found that staff members at an outpatient'),\n",

Attitudes were stronger when staff treated patients with a psychosis or in\\ninpatient settings. In a similar study,\\nMartensson, Jacobsson, and Engstrom (2014) found that staff had more positive attitudes towards\\npersons with mental illness if their knowledge of such disorders was less stigmatized; their workplaces\\nwere in the county council where they were more likely to encounter patients who recover and return to\\nnormal life in society, rather than in municipalities where patients have long-term and recurrent mental\\nillness; and they have or had one close friend with mental health issues.\\nTo help deal with stigma in the mental health community, Papish et al. (2013) investigated the effect of\\na one-time contact-based educational intervention compared to a four-week mandatory psychiatry\\ncourse on the stigma of mental illness among medical students at the University of Calgary. The\\ncurriculum included two methods requiring contact with people diagnosed with a mental disorder:\\npatient presentations, or two one-hour oral presentations in which patients shared their story of having\\na mental illness, and “clinical correlations” in which a psychiatrist mentored students while they\\ninteracted with patients in either inpatient or outpatient settings. Results showed that medical students\\nheld a stigma towards mental illness and that comprehensive medical education reduced this stigma. As\\nthe authors stated, “These results suggest that it is possible to create an environment in which medical\\nstudent attitudes towards mental illness can be shifted in a positive direction.” That said, the level of\\nstigma was still higher for mental illness than it was for the stigmatized physical illness, type 2 diabetes\\nmellitus.\\nWhat might happen if mental illness is presented as a treatable condition? McGinty, Goldman,\\nPescosolido, and Barry (2015) found that portraying schizophrenia, depression, and heroin addiction as\\nuntreated and symptomatic increased negative public attitudes towards people with these conditions.\\nConversely, when the same people were portrayed as successfully treated, the desire for social distance\\nwas reduced, there was less willingness to discriminate against them, and belief in treatment\\neffectiveness increased among the public.\\nSelf-stigma has also been shown to affect self-esteem, which then affects hope, which then affects the\\nquality of life among people with severe mental illness. As such, hope should play a central role in\\nrecovery (Mashiach-Eizenberg et al., 2013). Narrative Enhancement and Cognitive Therapy (NECT) is\\nan intervention designed to reduce internalized stigma and targets both hope and self-esteem (Yanos et\\nal., 2011). The intervention replaces stigmatizing myths with facts about illness and recovery, which\\nleads to hopefulness and higher levels of self-esteem in clients. This may then reduce susceptibility to\\ninternalized stigma.\\nStigma leads to health inequities (Hatzenbuehler, Phelan, & Link, 2013), prompting calls for stigma\\nchange. Targeting stigma involves two different agendas: The services agenda attempts to remove\\nstigma so people can seek mental health services, and the rights agenda tries to replace discrimination\\nthat “robs people of rightful opportunities with affirming attitudes and behavior” (Corrigan, 2016). The\\nformer is successful when there is evidence that people with mental illness are seeking services more or\\nbecoming better engaged. The latter is successful when there is an increase in the number of people\\nwith mental illnesses in the workforce who are receiving reasonable accommodations. The federal\\ngovernment has tackled this issue with landmark legislation such as the Patient Protection and\\nAffordable Care Act of 2010, Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008, and the Americans'),\n",

In this section, we\\nwill examine how past societies viewed and dealt with mental illness.\\n \\n1.4.1. Prehistoric and Ancient Beliefs\\nPrehistoric cultures often held a supernatural view of abnormal behavior and saw it as the work of evil\\nspirits, demons, gods, or witches who took control of the person. This form of demonic possession often\\noccurred when the person engaged in behavior contrary to the religious teachings of the time.\\nTreatment by cave dwellers included a technique called trephination, in which a stone instrument\\nknown as a trephine was used to remove part of the skull, creating an opening. Through it, the evil\\nspirits could escape, thereby ending the person’s mental affliction and returning them to normal\\nbehavior. Early Greek, Hebrew, Egyptian, and Chinese cultures used a treatment method called\\nexorcism in which evil spirts were cast out through prayer, magic, flogging, starvation, having the\\nperson ingest horrible tasting drinks, or noisemaking.\\n \\n1.4.2. Greco-Roman Thought\\nRejecting the idea of demonic possession, Greek physician Hippocrates (460-377 B.C.) said that mental\\ndisorders were akin to physical ailments and had natural causes. Specifically, they arose from brain\\npathology, or head trauma/brain dysfunction or disease, and were also affected by heredity.\\nHippocrates classified mental disorders into three main categories – melancholia, mania, and phrenitis\\n(brain fever) – and gave detailed clinical descriptions of each. He also described four main fluids or\\nhumors that directed normal brain functioning and personality – blood which arose in the heart, black\\nbile arising in the spleen, yellow bile or choler from the liver, and phlegm from the brain. Mental\\ndisorders occurred when the humors were in a state of imbalance such as an excess of yellow bile\\ncausing frenzy and too much black bile causing melancholia or depression. Hippocrates believed mental\\nillnesses could be treated as any other disorder and focused on the underlying pathology.\\nAlso noteworthy was the Greek philosopher Plato (429-347 B.C.), who said that the mentally ill were not\\nresponsible for their actions and should not be punished. It was the responsibility of the community and\\ntheir families to care for them. The Greek physician Galen (A.D. 129-199) said mental disorders had\\neither physical or psychological causes, including fear, shock, alcoholism, head injuries, adolescence,\\nand changes in menstruation.\\nIn Rome, physician Asclepiades (124-40 BC) and philosopher Cicero (106-43 BC) rejected Hippocrates’\\nidea of the four humors and instead stated that melancholy arises from grief, fear, and rage; not excess\\nblack bile. Roman physicians treated mental disorders with massage or warm baths, the hope being that\\ntheir patients would be as comfortable as they could be. They practiced the concept of contrariis\\ncontrarius, meaning opposite by opposite, and introduced contrasting stimuli to bring about balance in\\nthe physical and mental domains. An example would be consuming a cold drink while in a warm bath.'),\n",

The Middle Ages – 500 AD to 1500 AD\\nThe progress made during the time of the Greeks and Romans was quickly reversed during the Middle\\nAges with the increase in power of the Church and the fall of the Roman Empire. Mental illness was yet\\nagain explained as possession by the Devil and methods such as exorcism, flogging, prayer, the\\ntouching of relics, chanting, visiting holy sites, and holy water were used to rid the person of demonic\\ninfluence. In extreme cases, the afflicted were exposed to confinement, beatings, and even execution.\\nScientific and medical explanations, such as those proposed by Hippocrates, were discarded.\\nGroup hysteria, or mass madness, was also seen when large numbers of people displayed similar\\nsymptoms and false beliefs. This included the belief that one was possessed by wolves or other animals\\nand imitated their behavior, called lycanthropy, and a mania in which large numbers of people had an\\nuncontrollable desire to dance and jump, called tarantism. The latter was believed to have been caused\\nby the bite of the wolf spider, now called the tarantula, and spread quickly from Italy to Germany and\\nother parts of Europe where it was called Saint Vitus’s dance.\\nPerhaps the return to supernatural explanations during the Middle Ages makes sense given events of\\nthe time. The black death (bubonic plague) killed up to a third, or according to other estimates almost\\nhalf, of the population. Famine, war, social oppression, and pestilence were also factors. The constant\\npresence of death led to an epidemic of depression and fear. Near the end of the Middle Ages, mystical\\nexplanations for mental illness began to lose favor, and government officials regained some of their lost\\npower over nonreligious activities. Science and medicine were again called upon to explain\\npsychopathology.\\n \\n1.4.4. The Renaissance – 14th to 16th centuries\\nThe most noteworthy development in the realm of philosophy during the Renaissance was the rise of\\nhumanism, or the worldview that emphasizes human welfare and the uniqueness of the individual. This\\nperspective helped continue the decline of supernatural views of mental illness. In the mid to late\\n1500s, German physician Johann Weyer (1515-1588) published his book, On the Deceits of the Demons,\\nthat rebutted the Church’s witch-hunting handbook, the Malleus Maleficarum, and argued that many\\naccused of being witches and subsequently imprisoned, tortured, and/or burned at the stake, were\\nmentally disturbed and not possessed by demons or the Devil himself. He believed that like the body,\\nthe mind was susceptible to illness. Not surprisingly, the book was vehemently protested and banned by\\nthe Church. It should be noted that these types of acts occurred not only in Europe, but also in the\\nUnited States. The most famous example, the Salem Witch Trials of 1692, resulted in more than 200\\npeople accused of practicing witchcraft and 20 deaths.\\nThe number of asylums, or places of refuge for the mentally ill where they could receive care, began to\\nrise during the 16th century as the government realized there were far too many people afflicted with\\nmental illness to be left in private homes. Hospitals and monasteries were converted into asylums.\\nThough the intent was benign in the beginning, as the facilities overcrowded, the patients came to be\\ntreated more like animals than people. In 1547, the Bethlem Hospital opened in London with the sole\\npurpose of confining those with mental disorders. Patients were chained up, placed on public display,\\nand often heard crying out in pain. The asylum became a tourist attraction, with sightseers paying a\\npenny to view the more violent patients, and soon was called “Bedlam” by local people; a term that\\ntoday means “a state of uproar and confusion” (https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bedlam).'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n32\\n \\n1.4.5. Reform Movement – 18th to 19th centuries\\nThe rise of the moral treatment movement occurred in Europe in the late 18th century and then in\\nthe United States in the early 19th century. The earliest proponent was Francis Pinel (1745-1826), the\\nsuperintendent of la Bicetre, a hospital for mentally ill men in Paris. Pinel stressed respectful treatment\\nand moral guidance for the mentally ill while considering their individual, social, and occupational\\nneeds. Arguing that the mentally ill were sick people, Pinel ordered that chains be removed, outside\\nexercise be allowed, sunny and well-ventilated rooms replace dungeons, and patients be extended\\nkindness and support. This approach led to considerable improvement for many of the patients, so much\\nso, that several were released.\\nFollowing Pinel’s lead, William Tuke (1732-1822), a Quaker tea merchant, established a pleasant rural\\nestate called the York Retreat. The Quakers believed that all people should be accepted for who they\\nare and treated kindly. At the retreat, patients could work, rest, talk out their problems, and pray (Raad\\n& Makari, 2010). The work of Tuke and others led to the passage of the Country Asylums Act of 1845,\\nwhich required that every county provide asylum to the mentally ill. This sentiment extended to English\\ncolonies such as Canada, India, Australia, and the West Indies as word of the maltreatment of patients\\nat a facility in Kingston, Jamaica spread, leading to an audit of colonial facilities and their policies.\\nReform in the United States started with the figure largely considered to be the father of American\\npsychiatry, Benjamin Rush (1745-1813). Rush advocated for the humane treatment of the mentally ill,\\nshowing them respect, and even giving them small gifts from time to time.  Despite this, his practice\\nincluded treatments such as bloodletting and purgatives, the invention of the “tranquilizing chair,” and\\nreliance on astrology, showing that even he could not escape from the beliefs of the time.\\nDue to the rise of the moral treatment movement in both Europe and the United States, asylums\\nbecame habitable places where those afflicted with mental illness could recover. Regrettably, its\\nsuccess was responsible for its decline. The number of mental hospitals greatly increased, leading to\\nstaffing shortages and a lack of funds to support them. Though treating patients humanely was a noble\\nendeavor, it did not work for some patients and other treatments were needed, though they had not\\nbeen developed yet. Staff recognized that the approach worked best when the facility had 200 or fewer\\npatients, but waves of immigrants arriving in the U.S. after the Civil War overwhelmed the facilities,\\nand patient counts soared to 1,000 or more. Prejudice against the new arrivals led to discriminatory\\npractices in which immigrants were not afforded the same moral treatments as native citizens, even\\nwhen the resources were available to treat them.\\nThe moral treatment movement also fell due to the rise of the mental hygiene movement, which\\nfocused on the physical well-being of patients. Its leading proponent in the United States was Dorothea\\nDix (1802-1887), a New Englander who observed the deplorable conditions suffered by the mentally ill\\nwhile teaching Sunday school to female prisoners. Over the next 40 years, from 1841 to 1881, she\\nmotivated people and state legislators to do something about this injustice and raised millions of dollars\\nto build over 30 more appropriate mental hospitals and improve others. Her efforts even extended\\nbeyond the U.S. to Canada and Scotland.\\nFinally, in 1908 Clifford Beers (1876-1943) published his book, A Mind that Found Itself, in which he\\ndescribed his struggle with bipolar disorder and the “cruel and inhumane treatment people with mental\\nillnesses received. He witnessed and experienced horrific abuse at the hands of his caretakers. At one'),\n",

His story aroused sympathy from the public and led him to\\nfound the National Committee for Mental Hygiene, known today as Mental Health America, which\\nprovides education about mental illness and the need to treat these people with dignity. Today, MHA\\nhas over 200 affiliates in 41 states and employs 6,500 affiliate staff and over 10,000 volunteers.\\n“In the early 1950s, Mental Health America issued a call to asylums across the country for their\\ndiscarded chains and shackles. On April 13, 1953, at the McShane Bell Foundry in Baltimore, Md.,\\nMental Health America melted down these inhumane bindings and recast them into a sign of hope: the\\nMental Health Bell.\\nNow the symbol of Mental Health America, the 300-pound Bell serves as a powerful reminder that the\\ninvisible chains of misunderstanding and discrimination continue to bind people with mental illnesses.\\nToday, the Mental Health Bell rings out hope for improving mental health and achieving victory over\\nmental illnesses.”\\nFor more information on MHA, please visit: https://www.mhanational.org/\\n \\n1.4.6. 20th – 21st Centuries\\nThe decline of the moral treatment approach in the late 19th century led to the rise of two competing\\nperspectives – the biological or somatogenic perspective and the psychological or psychogenic\\nperspective.\\n     1.4.6.1. Biological or Somatogenic Perspective. Recall that Greek physicians Hippocrates and\\nGalen said that mental disorders were akin to physical disorders and had natural causes. Though the\\nidea fell into oblivion for several centuries, it re-emerged in the late 19th century for two reasons.  First,\\nGerman psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin (1856-1926) discovered that symptoms occurred regularly in\\nclusters, which he called syndromes. These syndromes represented a unique mental disorder with a\\ndistinct cause, course, and prognosis. In 1883 he published his textbook, Compendium der Psychiatrie\\n(Textbook of Psychiatry), and described a system for classifying mental disorders that became the basis\\nof the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)\\nthat is currently in its 5th edition Text Revision (published in 2022).\\nSecondly, in 1825, the behavioral and cognitive symptoms of advanced syphilis were identified to\\ninclude a belief that everyone is plotting against you or that you are God (a delusion of grandeur), and\\nwere termed general paresis by French physician A.L.J. Bayle. In 1897, Viennese psychiatrist Richard\\nvon Krafft-Ebbing injected patients suffering from general paresis with matter from syphilis spores and\\nnoted that none of the patients developed symptoms of syphilis, indicating they must have been\\npreviously exposed and were now immune. This led to the conclusion that syphilis was the cause of the\\ngeneral paresis. In 1906, August von Wassermann developed a blood test for syphilis, and in 1917 a\\ncure was found. Julius von Wagner-Jauregg noticed that patients with general paresis who contracted\\nmalaria recovered from their symptoms. To test this hypothesis, he injected nine patients with blood\\nfrom a soldier afflicted with malaria. Three of the patients fully recovered while three others showed\\ngreat improvement in their paretic symptoms. The high fever caused by malaria burned out the syphilis\\nbacteria. Hospitals in the United States began incorporating this new cure for paresis into their\\ntreatment approach by 1925.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n34\\nAlso noteworthy was the work of American psychiatrist John P. Grey. Appointed as superintendent of\\nthe Utica State Hospital in New York, Grey asserted that insanity always had a physical cause. As such,\\nthe mentally ill should be seen as physically ill and treated with rest, proper room temperature and\\nventilation, and a nutritive diet.\\nThe 1930s also saw the use of electric shock as a treatment method, which was stumbled upon\\naccidentally by Benjamin Franklin while experimenting with electricity in the early 18th century. He\\nnoticed that after suffering a severe shock his memories had changed, and in published work, he\\nsuggested physicians study electric shock as a treatment for melancholia.\\n            1.4.6.2. Psychological or Psychogenic Perspective. The psychological or psychogenic\\nperspective states that emotional or psychological factors are the cause of mental disorders and\\nrepresented a challenge to the biological perspective. This perspective had a long history but did not\\ngain favor until the work of Viennese physician Franz Anton Mesmer (1734-1815). Influenced heavily by\\nNewton’s theory of gravity, he believed that the planets also affected the human body through the force\\nof animal magnetism and that all people had a universal magnetic fluid that determined how healthy\\nthey were. He demonstrated the usefulness of his approach when he cured Franzl Oesterline, a 27-year-\\nold woman suffering from what he described as a convulsive malady. Mesmer used a magnet to disrupt\\nthe gravitational tides that were affecting his patient and produced a sensation of the magnetic fluid\\ndraining from her body. This procedure removed the illness from her body and provided a near-\\ninstantaneous recovery. In reality, the patient was placed in a trancelike state which made her highly\\nsuggestible. With other patients, Mesmer would have them sit in a darkened room filled with soothing\\nmusic, into which he would enter dressed in a colorful robe and pass from person to person touching\\nthe afflicted area of their body with his hand or a rod/wand. He successfully cured deafness, paralysis,\\nloss of bodily feeling, convulsions, menstrual difficulties, and blindness.\\nHis approach gained him celebrity status as he demonstrated it at the courts of English nobility.\\nHowever, the medical community was hardly impressed. A royal commission was formed to investigate\\nhis technique but could not find any proof for his theory of animal magnetism. Though he was able to\\ncure patients when they touched his “magnetized” tree, the result was the same when “non-\\nmagnetized” trees were touched. As such, Mesmer was deemed a charlatan and forced to leave Paris.\\nHis technique was called mesmerism, better known today as hypnosis.\\nThe psychological perspective gained popularity after two physicians practicing in the city of Nancy in\\nFrance discovered that they could induce the symptoms of hysteria in perfectly healthy patients through\\nhypnosis and then remove the symptoms in the same way. The work of Hippolyte-Marie Bernheim\\n(1840-1919) and Ambroise-Auguste Liebault (1823-1904) came to be part of what was called the Nancy\\nSchool and showed that hysteria was nothing more than a form of self-hypnosis. In Paris, this view was\\nchallenged by Jean Charcot (1825-1893), who stated that hysteria was caused by degenerative brain\\nchanges, reflecting the biological perspective. He was proven wrong and eventually turned to their way\\nof thinking.\\nThe use of hypnosis to treat hysteria was also carried out by fellow Frenchman Pierre Janet\\n(1859-1947), and student of Charcot, who believed that hysteria had psychological, not biological\\ncauses. Namely, these included unconscious forces, fixed ideas, and memory impairments. In Vienna,\\nJosef Breuer (1842-1925) induced hypnosis and had patients speak freely about past events that upset\\nthem. Upon waking, he discovered that patients sometimes were free of their symptoms of hysteria.\\nSuccess was even greater when patients not only recalled forgotten memories but also relived them'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n35\\nemotionally. He called this the cathartic method, and our use of the word catharsis today indicates a\\npurging or release, in this case, of pent-up emotion.\\nBy the end of the 19th century, it had become evident that mental disorders were caused by a\\ncombination of biological and psychological factors, and the investigation of how they develop began.\\nSigmund Freud’s development of psychoanalysis followed on the heels of the work of Bruner, and others\\nwho came before him.\\n \\n1.4.7. Current Views/Trends\\n            1.4.7.1. Mental illness today. An article published by the Harvard Medical School in March\\n2014 called “The Prevalence and Treatment of Mental Illness Today” presented the results of the\\nNational Comorbidity Study Replication of 2001-2003, which included a sample of more than 9,000\\nadults. The results showed that nearly 46% of the participants had a psychiatric disorder at some time\\nin their lives. The most commonly reported disorders were:\\nMajor depression – 17%\\nAlcohol abuse – 13%\\nSocial anxiety disorder – 12%\\nConduct disorder – 9.5%\\nAlso of interest was that women were more likely to have had anxiety and mood disorders while men\\nshowed higher rates of impulse control disorders. Comorbid anxiety and mood disorders were common,\\nand 28% reported having more than one co-occurring disorder (Kessler, Berglund, et al., 2005; Kessler,\\nChiu, et al., 2005; Kessler, Demler, et al., 2005).\\nAbout 80% of the sample reported seeking treatment for their disorder, but with as much as a 10-year\\ngap after symptoms first appeared. Women were more likely than men to seek help while whites were\\nmore likely than African and Hispanic Americans (Wang, Berglund, et al., 2005; Wang, Lane, et al.,\\n2005). Care was sought primarily from family doctors, nurses, and other general practitioners (23%),\\nfollowed by social workers and psychologists (16%), psychiatrists (12%), counselors or spiritual advisers\\n(8%), and complementary and alternative medicine providers (CAMs; 7%).\\nIn terms of the quality of the care, the article states:\\nMost of this treatment was inadequate, at least by the standards applied in the survey. The researchers\\ndefined minimum adequacy as a suitable medication at a suitable dose for two months, along with at\\nleast four visits to a physician; or else eight visits to any licensed mental health professional. By that\\ndefinition, only 33% of people with a psychiatric disorder were treated adequately, and only 13% of\\nthose who saw general medical practitioners.\\nIn comparison to the original study conducted from 1991-1992, the use of mental health services has\\nincreased over 50% during this decade. This may be attributed to treatment becoming more widespread\\nand increased attempts to educate the public about mental illness. Stigma, discussed in Section 1.3, has\\nreduced over time, diagnosis is more effective, community outreach programs have increased, and most\\nimportantly, general practitioners have been more willing to prescribe psychoactive medications which\\nthemselves are more readily available now. The article concludes, “Survey researchers also suggest that'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n36\\nwe need more outreach and voluntary screening, more education about mental illness for the public and\\nphysicians, and more effort to treat substance abuse and impulse control disorders.” We will explore\\nseveral of these issues in the remainder of this section, including the use of psychiatric drugs and\\ndeinstitutionalization, managed health care, private psychotherapy, positive psychology and prevention\\nscience, multicultural psychology, and prescription rights for psychologists.\\n            1.4.7.2. Use of psychiatric drugs and deinstitutionalization. Beginning in the 1950s,\\npsychiatric or psychotropic drugs were used for the treatment of mental illness and made an immediate\\nimpact. Though drugs alone cannot cure mental illness, they can improve symptoms and increase the\\neffectiveness of treatments such as psychotherapy. Classes of psychiatric drugs include anti-\\ndepressants used to treat depression and anxiety, mood-stabilizing medications to treat bipolar\\ndisorder, anti-psychotic drugs to treat schizophrenia, and anti-anxiety drugs to treat generalized anxiety\\ndisorder or panic disorder\\nFrank (2006) found that by 1996, psychotropic drugs were used in 77% of mental health cases and\\nspending on these drugs grew from $2.8 billion in 1987 to about $18 billion in 2001 (Coffey et al., 2000;\\nMark et al., 2005), representing over a sixfold increase. The largest classes of psychotropic drugs are\\nanti-psychotics and anti-depressants, followed closely by anti-anxiety medications. Frank, Conti, and\\nGoldman (2005) point out, “The expansion of insurance coverage for prescription drugs, the\\nintroduction and diffusion of managed behavioral health care techniques, and the conduct of the\\npharmaceutical industry in promoting their products all have influenced how psychotropic drugs are\\nused and how much is spent on them.” Is it possible then that we are overprescribing these mediations?\\nDavey (2014) provides ten reasons why this may be so, including leading suffers from believing that\\nrecovery is in their hands but instead in the hands of their doctors; increased risk of relapse; drug\\ncompanies causing the “medicalization of perfectly normal emotional processes, such as bereavement”\\nto ensure their survival; side effects; and a failure to change the way the person thinks or the\\nsocioeconomic environments that may be the cause of the disorder. For more on this article, please see:\\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/why-we-worry/201401/overprescribing-drugs-treat-mental-healt\\nh-problems. Smith (2012) echoed similar sentiments in an article on inappropriate prescribing. He cites\\nthe approval of Prozac by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1987 as when the issue began and\\nthe overmedication/overdiagnosis of children with ADHD as a more recent example.\\nA result of the use of psychiatric drugs was deinstitutionalization, or the release of patients from\\nmental health facilities. This shifted resources from inpatient to outpatient care and placed the spotlight\\nback on the biological or somatogenic perspective.  When people with severe mental illness do need\\ninpatient care, it is typically in the form of short-term hospitalization.\\n            1.4.7.3. Managed health care. Managed health care is a term used to describe a type of\\nhealth insurance in which the insurance company determines the cost of services, possible providers,\\nand the number of visits a subscriber can have within a year. This is regulated through contracts with\\nproviders and medical facilities. The plans pay the providers directly, so subscribers do not have to pay\\nout-of-pocket or complete claim forms, though most require co-pays paid directly to the provider at the\\ntime of service. Exactly how much the plan costs depends on how flexible the subscriber wants it to be;\\nthe more flexibility, the higher the cost. Managed health care takes three forms:\\nHealth Maintenance Organizations (HMO) – Typically only pay for care within the network. The\\nsubscriber chooses a primary care physician (PCP) who coordinates most of their care. The PCP\\nrefers the subscriber to specialists or other health care providers as is necessary. This is the most'),\n",

This system was\\ndeveloped in the 1980s to combat the rising cost of mental health care and took responsibility away\\nfrom single practitioners or small groups who could charge what they felt was appropriate. The actual\\nimpact of managed care on mental health services is still questionable at best.\\n            1.4.7.4. Multicultural psychology. As our society becomes increasingly diverse, medical\\npractitioners and psychologists alike must take into account the patient’s gender, age, race, ethnicity,\\nsocioeconomic (SES) status, and culture and how these factors shape the individual’s thoughts, feelings,\\nand behaviors. Additionally, we need to understand how the various groups, whether defined by race,\\nculture, or gender, differ from one another. This approach is called multicultural psychology.\\nIn August 2002, the American Psychological Association’s (APA) Council of Representatives put forth six\\nguidelines based on the understanding that “race and ethnicity can impact psychological practice and\\ninterventions at all levels” and the need for respect and inclusiveness. They further state, “psychologists\\nare in a position to provide leadership as agents of prosocial change, advocacy, and social justice,\\nthereby promoting societal understanding, affirmation, and appreciation of multiculturalism against the\\ndamaging effects of individual, institutional, and societal racism, prejudice, and all forms of oppression\\nbased on stereotyping and discrimination.” The guidelines from the 2002 document are as follows:\\n“Guideline #1: Psychologists are encouraged to recognize that, as cultural beings, they may hold\\nattitudes and beliefs that can detrimentally influence their perceptions of and interactions with\\nindividuals who are ethnically and racially different from themselves.\\nGuideline #2: Psychologists are encouraged to recognize the importance of multicultural\\nsensitivity/responsiveness, knowledge, and understanding about ethnically and racially different\\nindividuals.\\nGuideline #3: As educators, psychologists are encouraged to employ the constructs of\\nmulticulturalism and diversity in psychological education.\\nGuideline #4: Culturally sensitive psychological researchers are encouraged to recognize the\\nimportance of conducting culture–centered and ethical psychological research among persons\\nfrom ethnic, linguistic, and racial minority backgrounds.\\nGuideline #5: Psychologists strive to apply culturally-appropriate skills in clinical and other\\napplied psychological practices.\\nGuideline #6: Psychologists are encouraged to use organizational change processes to support\\nculturally informed organizational (policy) development and practices.”\\nSource: https://apa.org/pi/oema/resources/policy/multicultural-guidelines.aspx\\n \\nThis type of sensitivity training is vital because bias based on ethnicity, race, and culture has been\\nfound in the diagnosis and treatment of autism (Harrison et al., 2017; Burkett, 2015), borderline'),\n",

Women were\\noffered an appointment time in their preferred time range more than men were, though average\\nappointment offer rates were similar between genders (Kugelmass, 2016). These findings collectively\\nshow that though we are becoming more culturally sensitive, we have a lot more work to do.\\n            1.4.7.5. Prescription rights for psychologists. To reduce inappropriate prescribing as\\ndescribed in 1.4.7.2, it has been proposed to allow appropriately trained psychologists the right to\\nprescribe. Psychologists are more likely to utilize both therapy and medication, and so can make the\\nbest choice for their patient. The right has already been granted in New Mexico, Louisiana, Guam, the\\nmilitary, the Indian Health Services, and the U.S. Public Health Services. Measures in other states\\n“have been opposed by the American Medical Association and American Psychiatric Association over\\nconcerns that inadequate training of psychologists could jeopardize patient safety. Supporters of\\nprescriptive authority for psychologists are quick to point out that there is no evidence to support these\\nconcerns” (Smith, 2012).\\n            1.4.7.6. Prevention science. As a society, we used to wait for a mental or physical health\\nissue to emerge, then scramble to treat it. More recently, medicine and science has taken a prevention\\nstance, identifying the factors that cause specific mental health issues and implementing interventions\\nto stop them from happening, or at least minimize their deleterious effects. Our focus has shifted from\\nindividuals to the population. Mental health promotion programs have been instituted with success in\\nschools (Shoshani & Steinmetz, 2014; Weare & Nind, 2011; Berkowitz & Beer, 2007), in the workplace\\n(Czabała, Charzyńska,  & Mroziak, B., 2011), with undergraduate and graduate students (Conley et al.,\\n2017; Bettis et al., 2016), in relation to bullying (Bradshaw, 2015), and with the elderly (Forsman et al.,\\n2011). Many researchers believe it is the ideal time to move from knowledge to action and to expand\\npublic mental health initiatives (Wahlbeck, 2015). The growth of positive psychology in the late 1990s\\nhas further propelled this movement forward. For more on positive psychology, please see Section\\n1.1.1.\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nSome of the earliest views of mental illness saw it as the work of evil spirts, demons, gods, or\\nwitches who took control of the person, and in the Middle Ages it was seen as possession by the\\nDevil and methods such as exorcism, flogging, prayer, the touching of relics, chanting, visiting\\nholy sites, and holy water were used to rid the person of demonic influence.\\nDuring the Renaissance, humanism was on the rise which emphasized human welfare and the\\nuniqueness of the individual and led to an increase in the number of asylums as places of refuge'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n40\\nStill, before we proceed, it is prudent to further elaborate on what makes psychology scientific. It is safe\\nto say that most people outside of our discipline or a sister science would be surprised to learn that\\npsychology utilizes the scientific method at all. That may be even truer of clinical psychology, especially\\nin light of the plethora of self-help books found at any bookstore. But yes, the treatment methods used\\nby mental health professionals are based on empirical research and the scientific method.\\nAs a starting point, we should expand on what the scientific method is.\\nThe scientific method is a systematic method for gathering knowledge about the world around us.\\nThe keyword here is systematic, meaning there is a set way to use it. What is that way? Well, depending\\non what source you look at, it can include a varying number of steps. I like to use the following:\\n \\nTable 1.1: The Steps of the Scientific Method\\nStep Name Description\\n0\\nAsk questions and\\nbe willing to\\nwonder.\\nTo study the world around us, you have to wonder about it. This inquisitive\\nnature is the hallmark of critical thinking —our ability to assess claims\\nmade by others and make objective judgments that are independent of\\nemotion and anecdote and based on hard evidence —and a requirement to\\nbe a scientist.\\n1\\nGenerate a\\nresearch question\\nor identify a\\nproblem to\\ninvestigate.\\nThrough our wonderment about the world around us and why events occur\\nas they do, we begin to ask questions that require further investigation to\\narrive at an answer. This investigation usually starts with a literature\\nreview, or when we conduct a literature search through our university\\nlibrary or a search engine such as Google Scholar to see what questions\\nhave been investigated already and what answers have been found, so that\\nwe can identify gaps or holes in this body of work.\\n2\\nAttempt to explain\\nthe phenomena we\\nwish to study.\\nWe now attempt to formulate an explanation of why the event occurs as it\\ndoes. This systematic explanation of a phenomenon is a theory and our\\nspecific, testable prediction is the hypothesis. We will know if our theory is\\ncorrect because we have formulated a hypothesis that we can now test.\\n \\n3 Test the\\nhypothesis.\\nIt goes without saying that if we cannot test our hypothesis, then we cannot\\nshow whether our prediction is correct or not. Our plan of action of how we\\nwill go about testing the hypothesis is called our research design. In the\\nplanning stage, we will select the appropriate research method to answer\\nour question/test our hypothesis.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n41\\n4 Interpret the\\nresults.\\nWith our research study done, we now examine the data to see if the pattern\\nwe predicted exists. We need to see if a cause and effect statement can be\\nmade, assuming our method allows for this inference. More on this in\\nSection 2.3. For now, it is essential to know that statistics have two forms.\\nFirst, there are descriptive statistics which provide a means of\\nsummarizing or describing data and presenting the data in a usable form.\\nYou likely have heard of mean or average, median, and mode. Along with\\nstandard deviation and variance, these are ways to describe our data.\\nSecond, there are inferential statistics that allow for the analysis of two or\\nmore sets of numerical data to determine the statistical significance of the\\nresults. Significance is an indication of how confident we are that our results\\nare due to our manipulation or design and not chance.\\n5 Draw conclusions\\ncarefully.\\nWe need to interpret our results accurately and not overstate our findings.\\nTo do this, we need to be aware of our biases and avoid emotional reasoning\\nso that they do not cloud our judgment. How so? In our effort to stop a child\\nfrom engaging in self-injurious behavior that could cause substantial harm or\\neven death, we might overstate the success of our treatment method.\\n6\\nCommunicate our\\nfindings to the\\nbroader scientific\\ncommunity.\\nOnce we have decided on whether our hypothesis was correct or not, we\\nneed to share this information with others so that they might comment\\ncritically on our methodology, statistical analyses, and conclusions. Sharing\\nalso allows for replication or repeating the study to confirm its results.\\nCommunication occurs via scientific journals, conferences, or newsletters\\nreleased by many of the organizations mentioned in Module 1.6.\\n \\nScience has at its root three cardinal features that we will see play out time and time again throughout\\nthis book. They are:\\nObservation – To know about the world around us, we have to be able to see it firsthand. When a1.\\nmental disorder afflicts an individual, we can see it through their overt behavior. An individual\\nwith depression may withdraw from activities he/she enjoys, those with social anxiety disorder\\nwill avoid social situations, people with schizophrenia may express concern over being watched by\\nthe government, and individuals with dependent personality disorder may leave major decisions\\nto trusted companions. In these examples and numerous others, the behaviors that lead us to a\\ndiagnosis of a specific disorder can easily be observed by the clinician, the patient, and/or family\\nand friends.\\nExperimentation – To be able to make causal or cause and effect statements, we must isolate2.\\nvariables. We must manipulate one variable and see the effect of doing so on another variable.\\nLet’s say we want to know if a new treatment for bipolar disorder is as effective as existing\\ntreatments, or more importantly, better. We could design a study with three groups of bipolar\\npatients. One group would receive no treatment and serve as a control group. A second group\\nwould receive an existing and proven treatment and would also be considered a control group.\\nFinally, the third group would receive the new treatment and be the experimental group. What we\\nare manipulating is what treatment the groups get – no treatment, the older treatment, and the\\nnewer treatment. The first two groups serve as controls since we already know what to expect\\nfrom their results. There should be no change in bipolar disorder symptoms in the no-treatment\\ngroup, a general reduction in symptoms for the older treatment group, and the same or better\\nperformance for the newer treatment group. As long as patients in the newer treatment group do\\nnot perform worse than their older treatment counterparts, we can say the new drug is a success.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n42\\nYou might wonder why we would get excited about the performance of the new drug being the\\nsame as the old drug. Does it really offer any added benefit? In terms of a reduction of symptoms,\\nmaybe not, but it could cost less money than the older drug and that would be of value to patients.\\nMeasurement – How do we know that the new drug has worked? Simply, we can measure the3.\\nperson’s bipolar disorder symptoms before any treatment was implemented, and then again once\\nthe treatment has run its course.  This pre-post test design is typical in drug studies.\\n \\n1.5.2. Research Methods\\nStep 3 called on the scientist to test his or her hypothesis. Psychology as a discipline uses five main\\nresearch designs. They are:\\n            1.5.2.1. Naturalistic and laboratory observation. In terms of naturalistic observation, the\\nscientist studies human or animal behavior in its natural environment, which could include the home,\\nschool, or a forest. The researcher counts, measures, and rates behavior in a systematic way and, at\\ntimes, uses multiple judges to ensure accuracy in how the behavior is being measured. The advantage\\nof this method is that you see behavior as it happens, and the experimenter does not taint the data. The\\ndisadvantage is that it could take a long time for the behavior to occur, and if the researcher is\\ndetected, then this may influence the behavior of those being observed.\\nLaboratory observation involves observing people or animals in a laboratory setting. The researcher\\nmight want to know more about parent-child interactions, and so, brings a mother and her child into the\\nlab to engage in preplanned tasks such as playing with toys, eating a meal, or the mother leaving the\\nroom for a short time. The advantage of this method over the naturalistic method is that the\\nexperimenter can use sophisticated equipment to record the session and examine it later. The problem\\nis that since the subjects know the experimenter is watching them, their behavior could become\\nartificial. Clinical observation is a commonly employed research method to study psychopathology; we\\nwill talk about it more throughout this book.\\n            1.5.2.2. Case studies. Psychology can also utilize a detailed description of one person or a\\nsmall group based on careful observation. This was the approach the founder of psychoanalysis,\\nSigmund Freud, took to develop his theories. The advantage of this method is that you arrive at a\\ndetailed description of the investigated behavior, but the disadvantage is that the findings may be\\nunrepresentative of the larger population, and thus, lacking generalizability. Again, bear in mind that\\nyou are studying one person or a tiny group. Can you possibly make conclusions about all people from\\njust one person, or even five or ten? The other issue is that the case study is subject to researcher bias\\nin terms of what is included in the final narrative and what is left out. Despite these limitations, case\\nstudies can lead us to novel ideas about the cause of abnormal behavior and help us to study unusual\\nconditions that occur too infrequently to analyze with large sample sizes and in a systematic way.\\n            1.5.2.3. Surveys/Self-Report data. This is a questionnaire consisting of at least one scale with\\nsome questions used to assess a psychological construct of interest such as parenting style, depression,\\nlocus of control, or sensation-seeking behavior. It may be administered by paper and pencil or\\ncomputer. Surveys allow for the collection of large amounts of data quickly, but the actual survey could\\nbe tedious for the participant and social desirability, when a participant answers questions\\ndishonestly so that they are seen in a more favorable light, could be an issue. For instance, if you are\\nasking high school students about their sexual activity, they may not give genuine answers for fear that'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n43\\ntheir parents will find out. You could alternatively gather this information via an interview in a\\nstructured or unstructured fashion.\\n            1.5.2.4. Correlational research. This research method examines the relationship between\\ntwo variables or two groups of variables. A numerical measure of the strength of this relationship is\\nderived, called the correlation coefficient. It can range from -1.00, a perfect inverse relationship in\\nwhich one variable goes up as the other goes down, to 0 indicating no relationship at all, to +1.00 or a\\nperfect relationship in which as one variable goes up or down so does the other. In terms of a negative\\ncorrelation, we might say that as a parent becomes more rigid, controlling, and cold, the attachment of\\nthe child to parent goes down. In contrast, as a parent becomes warmer, more loving, and provides\\nstructure, the child becomes more attached. The advantage of correlational research is that you can\\ncorrelate anything. The disadvantage is that you can correlate anything, including variables that do not\\nhave any relationship with one another. Yes, this is both an advantage and a disadvantage. For instance,\\nwe might correlate instances of making peanut butter and jelly sandwiches with someone we are\\nattracted to sitting near us at lunch. Are the two related? Not likely, unless you make a really good\\nPB&J, but then the person is probably only interested in you for food and not companionship. The main\\nissue here is that correlation does not allow you to make a causal statement.\\nA special form of correlational research is the epidemiological study in which the prevalence and\\nincidence of a disorder in a specific population are measured (See Section 1.2 for definitions).\\n            1.5.2.5. Experiments. This is a controlled test of a hypothesis in which a researcher\\nmanipulates one variable and measures its effect on another variable. The manipulated variable is\\ncalled the independent variable (IV), and the one that is measured is called the dependent variable\\n(DV). In the example under Experimentation in Section 1.5.1, the treatment for bipolar disorder was\\nthe IV, while the actual intensity or number of symptoms serve as the DV.  A common feature of\\nexperiments is a control group that does not receive the treatment or is not manipulated and an\\nexperimental group that does receive the treatment or manipulation. If the experiment includes\\nrandom assignment, participants have an equal chance of being placed in the control or experimental\\ngroup. The control group allows the researcher (or teacher) to make a comparison to the experimental\\ngroup and make a causal statement possible, and stronger. In our experiment, the new treatment\\nshould show a marked reduction in the intensity of bipolar symptoms compared to the group receiving\\nno treatment, and perform either at the same level as, or better than, the older treatment. This would\\nbe the initial hypothesis made before starting the experiment.\\nIn a drug study, to ensure the participants’ expectations do not affect the final results by giving the\\nresearcher what he/she is looking for (in our example, symptoms improve whether the participant is\\nreceiving treatment or not), we might use what is called a placebo, or a sugar pill made to look exactly\\nlike the pill given to the experimental group. This way, participants all are given something, but cannot\\nfigure out what exactly it is. You might say this keeps them honest and allows the results to speak for\\nthemselves.\\nFinally, the study of mental illness does not always afford us a large sample of participants to study, so\\nwe have to focus on one individual using a single-subject experimental design. This differs from a\\ncase study in the sheer number of strategies available to reduce potential confounding variables, or\\nvariables not originally part of the research design but contribute to the results in a meaningful way.\\nOne type of single-subject experimental design is the reversal or ABAB design. Kuttler, Myles, and\\nCarson (1998) used social stories to reduce tantrum behavior in two social environments in a 12-year'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n44\\nold student diagnosed with autism, Fragile-X syndrome, and intermittent explosive disorder. Using an\\nABAB design, they found that precursors to tantrum behavior decreased when the social stories were\\navailable (B) and increased when the intervention was withdrawn (A). A more recent study\\n(Balakrishnan & Alias, 2017) also established the utility of social stories as a social learning tool for\\nchildren with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using an ABAB design. During the baseline phase (A), the\\nfour student participants were observed, and data recorded on an observation form. During the\\ntreatment phase (B), they listened to the social story and data was recorded in the same manner. Upon\\ncompletion of the first B, the students returned to A, which was followed one more time by B and the\\nreading of the social story. Once the second treatment phase ended, the participation was monitored\\nagain to obtain the outcome. All students showed improvement during the treatment phases in terms of\\nthe number of positive peer interactions, but the number of interactions reduced in the absence of\\nsocial stories. From this, the researchers concluded that the social story led to the increase in positive\\npeer interactions of children with ASD.\\n            1.5.2.6. Multi-method research. As you have seen above, no single method alone is perfect.\\nAll have strengths and limitations. As such, for the psychologist to provide the most precise picture of\\nwhat is affecting behavior or mental processes, several of these approaches are typically employed at\\ndifferent stages of the research study. This is called multi-method research.\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nThe scientific method is a systematic method for gathering knowledge about the world around us.\\nA systematic explanation of a phenomenon is a theory and our specific, testable prediction is the\\nhypothesis.\\nReplication is when we repeat the study to confirm its results.\\nPsychology’s five main research designs are observation, case studies, surveys, correlation, and\\nexperimentation.\\nNo single research method alone is perfect – all have strengths and limitations.\\n \\nSection 1.5 Review Questions\\nWhat is the scientific method and what steps make it up?1.\\nDifferentiate theory and hypothesis.2.\\nWhat are the three cardinal features of science and how do they relate to the study of mental3.\\ndisorders?\\nWhat are the five main research designs used by psychologists?

This single factor explanation is called a uni-dimensional model. The problem with this\\napproach is that mental disorders are not typically caused by a solitary factor, but multiple causes.\\nAdmittedly, single factors do emerge during a person’s life, but as they arise, the factors become part of\\nthe individual. In time, the cause of the person’s psychopathology is due to all these individual factors.\\n \\n2.1.2. Multi-Dimensional\\nSo, it is better to subscribe to a multi-dimensional model that integrates multiple causes of\\npsychopathology and affirms that each cause comes to affect other causes over time. Uni-dimensional\\nmodels alone are too simplistic to explain the etiology of mental disorders fully.\\nBefore introducing the current main models, it is crucial to understand what a model is. In a general\\nsense, a model is defined as a representation or imitation of an object (dictionary.com). For mental\\nhealth professionals, models help us to understand mental illness since diseases such as depression\\ncannot be touched or experienced firsthand. To be considered distinct from other conditions, a mental\\nillness must have its own set of symptoms. But as you will see, the individual does not have to present\\nwith the entire range of symptoms. For example, to be diagnosed with separation anxiety disorder, you\\nmust present with three of eight symptoms for criteria A whereas for a major depressive episode as part\\nof Bipolar II disorder, you have to display five (or more) symptoms for criteria A. There will be some\\nvariability in terms of what symptoms are displayed, but in general, all people with a specific\\npsychopathology have symptoms from that group.\\nWe can also ask the patient probing questions, seek information from family members, examine medical\\nrecords, and in time, organize and process all this information to better understand the person’s\\ncondition and potential causes. Models aid us with doing all of this. Still, we must remember that the\\nmodel is a starting point for the researcher, and due to this, it determines what causes might be\\ninvestigated at the exclusion of other causes. Often, proponents of a given model find themselves in\\ndisagreement with proponents of other models. All forget that there is no individual model that\\ncompletely explains human behavior, or in this case, abnormal behavior, and so each model contributes\\nin its own way. Here are the models we will examine in this module:\\nBiological – includes genetics, chemical imbalances in the brain, the functioning of the nervous\\nsystem, etc.\\nPsychological – includes learning, personality, stress, cognition, self-efficacy, and early life\\nexperiences. We will examine several perspectives that make up the psychological model to\\ninclude psychodynamic, behavioral, cognitive, and humanistic-existential.\\nSociocultural – includes factors such as one’s gender, religious orientation, race, ethnicity, and\\nculture.\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:'),\n",

To truly understand brain structure and\\nchemistry, it is a good idea to understand how communication occurs within the nervous system. See\\nFigure 2.1 below. Simply:\\nReceptor cells in each of the five sensory systems detect energy.1.\\nThis information is passed to the nervous system due to the process of transduction and through2.\\nsensory or afferent neurons, which are part of the peripheral nervous system.\\nThe information is received by brain structures (central nervous system) and perception occurs.3.\\nOnce the information has been interpreted, commands are sent out, telling the body how to4.\\nrespond (Step E), also via the peripheral nervous system.\\n \\nFigure 2.1. Communication in the Nervous System\\nPlease note that we will not cover this process in full, but just the parts relevant to our topic of\\npsychopathology.\\n            2.2.1.2. The nervous system. The nervous system consists of two main parts – the central and\\nperipheral nervous systems.  The central nervous system (CNS) is the control center for the nervous\\nsystem, which receives, processes, interprets, and stores incoming sensory information. It consists of\\nthe brain and spinal cord. The peripheral nervous system consists of everything outside the brain and\\nspinal cord. It handles the CNS’s input and output and divides into the somatic and autonomic nervous\\nsystems. The somatic nervous system allows for voluntary movement by controlling the skeletal\\nmuscles and carries sensory information to the CNS. The autonomic nervous system regulates the\\nfunctioning of blood vessels, glands, and internal organs such as the bladder, stomach, and heart. It\\nconsists of sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. The sympathetic nervous system is\\ninvolved when a person is intensely aroused. It provides the strength to fight back or to flee (fight-or-\\nflight instinct). Eventually, the response brought about by the sympathetic nervous system must end.\\nThe parasympathetic nervous system calms the body.'),\n",

The neuron. The fundamental unit of the nervous system is the neuron, or nerve cell\\n(See Figure 2.3). It has several structures in common with all cells in the body. The nucleus is the\\ncontrol center of the neuron, and the soma is the cell body. In terms of distinctive structures, these\\nfocus on the ability of a neuron to send and receive information. The axon sends signals/information to\\nneighboring neurons while the dendrites, which resemble little trees, receive information from\\nneighboring neurons. Note the plural form of dendrite and the singular form of axon; there are many\\ndendrites but only one axon. Also of importance to the neuron is the myelin sheath or the white, fatty\\ncovering which: 1) provides insulation so that signals from adjacent neurons do not affect one another\\nand, 2) increases the speed at which signals are transmitted. The axon terminals are the end of the\\naxon where the electrical impulse becomes a chemical message and passes to an adjacent neuron.\\nThough not neurons, glial cells play an important part in helping the nervous system to be the efficient\\nmachine that it is. Glial cells are support cells in the nervous system that serve five main functions:\\nThey act as a glue and hold the neuron in place.1.\\nThey form the myelin sheath.2.\\nThey provide nourishment for the cell.3.\\nThey remove waste products.4.\\nThey protect the neuron from harmful substances.5.\\nFinally, nerves are a group of axons bundled together like wires in an electrical cable.\\n \\nFigure 2.3.  The Structure of the Neuron'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n55\\n \\n            2.2.1.4. Neural transmission. Transducers or receptor cells in the major organs of our five\\nsensory systems – vision (the eyes), hearing (the ears), smell (the nose), touch (the skin), and taste (the\\ntongue) – convert the physical energy that they detect or sense and send it to the brain via the neural\\nimpulse. How so? See Figure 2.4 below. We will cover this process in three parts.\\n \\nPart 1. The Axon and Neural Impulse\\nThe neural impulse proceeds across the following steps:\\nStep 1 – Neurons waiting to fire are said to be in resting potential and polarized, or having a\\nnegative charge inside the neuron and a positive charge outside.\\nStep 2 – If adequately stimulated, the neuron experiences an action potential and becomes\\ndepolarized. When this occurs, voltage-gated ion channels open, allowing positively charged\\nsodium ions (Na+) to enter. This shifts the polarity to positive on the inside and negative outside.\\nNote that ions are charged particles found both inside and outside the neuron.\\nStep 3 – Once the action potential passes from one segment of the axon to the next, the previous\\nsegment begins to repolarize. This occurs because the Na channels close and potassium (K)\\nchannels open. K+ has a positive charge, so the neuron becomes negative again on the inside and\\npositive on the outside.\\nStep 4 – After the neuron fires, it will not fire again no matter how much stimulation it receives.\\nThis is called the absolute refractory period. Think of it as the neuron ABSOLUTELY will not\\nfire, no matter what.\\nStep 5 – After a short time, the neuron can fire again, but needs greater than normal levels of\\nstimulation to do so. This is called the relative refractory period.\\nStep 6 – Please note that this process is cyclical. We started at resting potential in Step 1 and end\\nat resting potential in Step 6.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n56\\n \\nPart 2. The Action Potential\\nLet’s look at the electrical portion of the process in another way and add some detail.\\n \\nFigure 2.4. The Action Potential\\nRecall that a neuron is usually at resting potential and polarized. The charge inside is -70mV at\\nrest.\\nIf it receives sufficient stimulation, causing the polarity inside the neuron to rise from -70 mV to\\n-55mV (threshold of excitation), the neuron will fire or send an electrical impulse down the\\nlength of the axon (the action potential or depolarization). It should be noted that it either hits\\n-55mV and fires, or it does not fire at all. This is the all-or-nothing principle. The threshold\\nmust be reached.\\nOnce the electrical impulse has passed from one segment of the axon to the next, the neuron\\nbegins the process of resetting called repolarization.\\nDuring repolarization the neuron will not fire no matter how much stimulation it receives. This is\\ncalled the absolute refractory period.\\nThe neuron next moves into a relative refractory period, meaning it can fire but needs higher than\\nnormal levels of stimulation. Notice how the line has dropped below -70mV. Hence, to reach\\n-55mV and fire, it will need more than the normal gain of +15mV (-70 to -55 mV).\\nAnd then we return to resting potential, as you saw in Figure 2.4\\n \\nPart 3. The Synapse\\nThe electrical portion of the neural impulse is just the start. The actual code passes from one neuron to\\nanother in a chemical form called a neurotransmitter. The point where this occurs is called the\\nsynapse. The synapse consists of three parts – the axon of the sending neuron, the space in between\\ncalled the synaptic space, gap, or cleft, and the dendrite of the receiving neuron. Once the electrical\\nimpulse reaches the end of the axon, called the axon terminal, it stimulates synaptic vesicles or\\nneurotransmitter sacs to release the neurotransmitter. Neurotransmitters will only bind to their specific'),\n",

You might say\\nneurotransmitters are part of a lock-and-key system. What happens to the neurotransmitters that do not\\nbind to a receptor site? They might go through reuptake, which is the process of the presynaptic\\nneuron taking up excess neurotransmitters in the synaptic space for future use or enzymatic\\ndegradation when enzymes destroy excess neurotransmitters in the synaptic space.\\n            2.2.1.5. Neurotransmitters. What exactly are some of the neurotransmitters which are so\\ncritical for neural transmission, and are essential to our discussion of psychopathology?\\nDopamine – controls voluntary movements and is associated with the reward mechanism in the\\nbrain\\nSerotonin – regulates pain, sleep cycle, and digestion; leads to a stable mood, so low levels lead\\nto depression\\nEndorphins – involved in reducing pain and making the person calm and happy\\nNorepinephrine – increases the heart rate and blood pressure and regulates mood\\nGABA – blocks the signals of excitatory neurotransmitters responsible for anxiety and panic\\nGlutamate – associated with learning and memory\\nThe critical thing to understand here is that there is a belief in the realm of mental health that chemical\\nimbalances are responsible for many mental disorders. Chief among these are neurotransmitter\\nimbalances. For instance, people with Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) have difficulty regulating\\nserotonin. More on this throughout the book as we discuss each disorder.\\n           2.2.1.6. The brain. The central nervous system consists of the brain and spinal cord; the\\nformer we will discuss briefly and in terms of key structures which include:\\nMedulla – regulates breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure\\nPons – acts as a bridge connecting the cerebellum and medulla and helps to transfer messages\\nbetween different parts of the brain and spinal cord\\nReticular formation – responsible for alertness and attention\\nCerebellum – involved in our sense of balance and for coordinating the body’s muscles so that\\nmovement is smooth and precise. Involved in the learning of certain kinds of simple responses and\\nacquired reflexes.\\nThalamus – the major sensory relay center for all senses except smell\\nHypothalamus – involved in drives associated with the survival of both the individual and the\\nspecies.

First, the frontal lobe\\ncontains the motor cortex, which issues orders to the muscles of the body that produce voluntary\\nmovement. The frontal lobe is also involved in emotion and in the ability to make plans, think\\ncreatively, and take initiative.

Finally, the temporal lobe is involved in memory,\\nperception, and emotion. It contains the auditory cortex which processes sound.\\nOf course, this is not an exhaustive list of structures found in the brain but gives you a pretty good idea\\nof function and which structure is responsible for it. What is important to mental health professionals is\\nsome disorders involve specific areas of the brain. For instance, Parkinson’s disease is a brain disorder\\nthat results in a gradual loss of muscle control and arises when cells in the substantia nigra, a long\\nnucleus considered to be part of the basal ganglia, stop making dopamine. As these cells die, the brain\\nfails to receive messages about when and how to move. In the case of depression, low levels of\\nserotonin are responsible, at least partially. New evidence suggests “nerve cell connections, nerve cell\\ngrowth, and the functioning of nerve circuits have a major impact on depression… and areas that play a\\nsignificant role in depression are the amygdala, the thalamus, and the hippocampus.” Also, individuals\\nwith borderline personality disorder have been shown to have structural and functional changes in\\nbrain areas associated with impulse control and emotional regulation, while imaging studies reveal\\ndifferences in the frontal cortex and subcortical structures for those suffering from OCD.\\nCheck out the following from Harvard Health for more on depression and the brain as a cause:\\nhttps://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/what-causes-depression\\n \\n2.2.2. Genes, Hormonal Imbalances, and Viral Infections\\n            2.2.2.1. Genetic issues and explanations. DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is our heredity\\nmaterial. It exists in the nucleus of each cell, packaged in threadlike structures known as chromosomes,\\nfor which we have 23 pairs or 46 total. Twenty-two of the pairs are the same in both sexes, but the 23rd\\npair is called the sex chromosome and differs between males and females. Males have X and Y\\nchromosomes while females have two Xs. According to the Genetics Home Reference website as part of\\nNIH’s National Library of Medicine, a gene is “the basic physical and functional unit of heredity”\\n(https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/basics/gene). They act as the instructions to make proteins, and it is\\nestimated by the Human Genome Project that we have between 20,000 and 25,000 genes. We all have\\ntwo copies of each gene, one inherited from our mother and one from our father.\\nRecent research has discovered that autism, ADHD, bipolar disorder, major depression, and\\nschizophrenia all share genetic roots. They “were more likely to have suspect genetic variation at the\\nsame four chromosomal sites. These included risk versions of two genes that regulate the flow of\\ncalcium into cells.” Likewise, twin and family studies have shown that people with first-degree relatives\\nsuffering from OCD are at higher risk to develop the disorder themselves. The same is true of\\nborderline personality disorder.\\nWebMD adds, “Experts believe many mental illnesses are linked to abnormalities in many genes rather\\nthan just one or a few and that how these genes interact with the environment is unique for every\\nperson (even identical twins). That is why a person inherits a susceptibility to a mental illness and\\ndoesn’t necessarily develop the illness. Mental illness itself occurs from the interaction of multiple\\ngenes and other factors–such as stress, abuse, or a traumatic event–which can influence, or trigger, an\\nillness in a person who has an inherited susceptibility to it”\\n(https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/mental-health-causes-mental-illness#1).'),\n",

Hormonal imbalances. The body has two coordinating and integrating systems, the\\nnervous system and the endocrine system. The main difference between these two systems is the speed\\nwith which they act. The nervous system moves quickly with nerve impulses moving in a few\\nhundredths of a second. The endocrine system moves slowly with hormones, released by endocrine\\nglands, taking seconds, or even minutes, to reach their target. Hormones are important to psychologists\\nbecause they manage the nervous system and body tissues at certain stages of development and\\nactivate behaviors such as alertness or sleepiness, sexual behavior, concentration, aggressiveness,\\nreaction to stress, and a desire for companionship. The pituitary gland is the “master gland” which\\nregulates other endocrine glands. It influences blood pressure, thirst, contractions of the uterus during\\nchildbirth, milk production, sexual behavior and interest, body growth, the amount of water in the\\nbody’s cells, and other functions as well. The pineal gland helps regulate the sleep-wake cycle while\\nthe thyroid gland regulates the body’s energy levels by controlling metabolism and the basal metabolic\\nrate (BMR). It regulates the body’s rate of metabolism and so how energetic people are.\\nOf importance to mental health professionals are the adrenal glands, located on top of the kidneys,\\nand which release cortisol to help the body deal with stress. Elevated levels of this hormone can lead to\\nseveral problems, including increased weight gain, interference with learning and memory, reduced\\nbone density, high cholesterol, and an increased risk of depression. Similarly, the overproduction of the\\nhormone melatonin can lead to SAD.\\nFor more on the link between cortisol and depression, check out this article:\\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-athletes-way/201301/cortisol-why-the-stress-hormone-is-pub\\nlic-enemy-no-1\\n      2.2.2.3. Bacterial and viral infections. Infections can cause brain damage and lead to the\\ndevelopment of mental illness or exacerbate existing symptoms. For instance, evidence suggests that\\ncontracting strep throat, “an infection in the throat and tonsils caused by bacteria called group A\\nStreptococcus” (for more on strep throat, please visit\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/groupastrep/diseases-public/strep-throat.html), can lead to the development of\\nOCD, Tourette’s syndrome, and tic disorder in children (Mell, Davis, & Owens, 2005; Giedd et al., 2000;\\nAllen et al., 1995;\\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-perfectionists-handbook/201202/can-infections-result-in-men\\ntal-illness). Influenza epidemics, caused by viral infections (for more on influenza, please see the\\nfollowing: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/flu/symptoms-causes/syc-20351719),  have\\nalso been linked to schizophrenia (Brown et al., 2004; McGrath and Castle, 1995; McGrath et al., 1994;\\nO’callaghan et al., 1991) though more recent research suggests this evidence is weak at best (Selten &\\nTermorshuizen, 2017; Ebert & Kotler, 2005).'),\n",

Psychopharmacology and psychotropic drugs. One option to treat severe mental\\nillness is psychotropic medications. These medications fall under five major categories.\\nAntidepressants are used to treat depression, but also anxiety, insomnia, and pain. The most common\\ntypes of antidepressants are SSRIs or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and include Citalopram,\\nParoxetine, and Fluoxetine (Prozac). Possible side effects include weight gain, sleepiness, nausea and\\nvomiting, panic attacks, or thoughts about suicide or dying.\\nAnti-anxiety medications help with the symptoms of anxiety and include benzodiazepines such as\\nClonazepam, Alprazolam, and Lorazepam. “Anti-anxiety medications such as benzodiazepines are\\neffective in relieving anxiety and take effect more quickly than the antidepressant medications (or\\nbuspirone) often prescribed for anxiety. However, people can build up a tolerance to benzodiazepines if\\nthey are taken over a long period of time and may need higher and higher doses to get the same effect.”\\nSide effects include drowsiness, dizziness, nausea, difficulty urinating, and irregular heartbeat, to name\\na few.\\nStimulants increase one’s alertness and attention and are frequently used to treat ADHD. They include\\nLisdexamfetamine, the combination of dextroamphetamine and amphetamine, and Methylphenidate.\\nStimulants are generally effective and produce a calming effect. Possible side effects include loss of\\nappetite, headache, motor or verbal tics, and personality changes such as appearing emotionless.\\nAntipsychotics are used to treat psychosis or “conditions that affect the mind, and in which there has\\nbeen some loss of contact with reality, often including delusions (false, fixed beliefs) or hallucinations\\n(hearing or seeing things that are not really there).” They can be used to treat eating disorders, severe\\ndepression, PTSD, OCD, ADHD, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Common antipsychotics include\\nChlorpromazine, Perphenazine, Quetiapine, and Lurasidone. Side effects include nausea, vomiting,\\nblurred vision, weight gain, restlessness, tremors, and rigidity.\\nMood stabilizers are used to treat bipolar disorder and, at times, depression, schizoaffective disorder,\\nand disorders of impulse control. A common example is Lithium; side effects include loss of\\ncoordination, hallucinations, seizures, and frequent urination.\\nFor more information on psychotropic medications, please visit:\\nhttps://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/mental-health-medications/index.shtml\\nThe use of these drugs has been generally beneficial to patients. Most report that their symptoms\\ndecline, leading them to feel better and improve their functioning. Also, long-term hospitalizations are\\nless likely to occur as a result, though the medications do not benefit the individual in terms of\\nimproved living skills.\\n            2.2.3.2. Electroconvulsive therapy. According to Mental Health America, “Electroconvulsive\\ntherapy (ECT) is a procedure in which a brief application of electric stimulus is used to produce a\\ngeneralized seizure.” Patients are placed on a padded bed and administered a muscle relaxant to avoid\\ninjury during the seizures. Annually, approximately 100,000 undergo ECT to treat conditions such as'),\n",

The book published several case studies, including that of Anna O., born February 27, 1859\\nin Vienna to Jewish parents Siegmund and Recha Pappenheim, strict Orthodox adherents who were\\nconsidered millionaires at the time. Bertha, known in published case studies as Anna O., was expected'),\n",

She felt confined and suffocated in this life and took\\nto a fantasy world she called her “private theater.” Anna also developed hysteria, including symptoms\\nsuch as memory loss, paralysis, disturbed eye movements, reduced speech, nausea, and mental\\ndeterioration. Her symptoms appeared as she cared for her dying father, and her mother called on\\nBreuer to diagnosis her condition (note that Freud never actually treated her). Hypnosis was used at\\nfirst and relieved her symptoms, as it had done for many patients (See Module 1). Breuer made daily\\nvisits and allowed her to share stories from her private theater, which she came to call “talking cure” or\\n“chimney sweeping.” Many of the stories she shared were actually thoughts or events she found\\ntroubling and reliving them helped to relieve or eliminate the symptoms. Breuer’s wife, Mathilde,\\nbecame jealous of her husband’s relationship with the young girl, leading Breuer to terminate treatment\\nin June of 1882 before Anna had fully recovered. She relapsed and was admitted to Bellevue Sanatorium\\non July 1, eventually being released in October of the same year. With time, Anna O. did recover from\\nher hysteria and went on to become a prominent member of the Jewish Community, involving herself in\\nsocial work, volunteering at soup kitchens, and becoming ‘House Mother’ at an orphanage for Jewish\\ngirls in 1895. Bertha (Anna O.) became involved in the German Feminist movement, and in 1904\\nfounded the League of Jewish Women. She published many short stories; a play called Women’s Rights,\\nin which she criticized the economic and sexual exploitation of women; and wrote a book in 1900 called\\nThe Jewish Problem in Galicia, in which she blamed the poverty of the Jews of Eastern Europe on their\\nlack of education. In 1935, Bertha was diagnosed with a tumor, and in 1936, she was summoned by the\\nGestapo to explain anti-Hitler statements she had allegedly made. She died shortly after this\\ninterrogation on May 28, 1936. Freud considered the talking cure of Anna O. to be the origin of\\npsychoanalytic therapy and what would come to be called the cathartic method.\\nFor more on Anna O., please see:\\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/freuds-patients-serial/201201/bertha-pappenheim-1859-1936\\n            2.3.1.1. The structure of personality. Freud’s psychoanalysis was unique in the history of\\npsychology because it did not arise within universities as most major schools of thought did; rather, it\\nemerged from medicine and psychiatry to address psychopathology and examine the unconscious.\\n Freud believed that consciousness had three levels – 1) consciousness which was the seat of our\\nawareness, 2) preconscious that included all of our sensations, thoughts, memories, and feelings, and\\n3) the unconscious, which was not available to us. The contents of the unconscious could move from\\nthe unconscious to preconscious, but to do so, it had to pass a Gate Keeper. Content that was turned\\naway was said to be repressed.\\nAccording to Freud, our personality has three parts – the id, superego, and ego, and from these our\\nbehavior arises. First, the id is the impulsive part that expresses our sexual and aggressive instincts. It\\nis present at birth, completely unconscious, and operates on the pleasure principle, resulting in selfishly\\nseeking immediate gratification of our needs no matter what the cost. The second part of personality\\nemerges after birth with early formative experiences and is called the ego. The ego attempts to mediate\\nthe desires of the id against the demands of reality, and eventually, the moral limitations or guidelines\\nof the superego. It operates on the reality principle, or an awareness of the need to adjust behavior, to\\nmeet the demands of our environment. The last part of the personality to develop is the superego,\\nwhich represents society’s expectations, moral standards, rules, and represents our conscience. It leads'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n64\\nus to adopt our parent’s values as we come to realize that many of the id’s impulses are unacceptable.\\nStill, we violate these values at times and experience feelings of guilt. The superego is partly conscious\\nbut mostly unconscious, and part of it becomes our conscience. The three parts of personality generally\\nwork together well and compromise, leading to a healthy personality, but if the conflict is not resolved,\\nintrapsychic conflicts can arise and lead to mental disorders.\\nPersonality develops over five distinct stages in which the libido focuses on different parts of the body.\\nFirst, libido is the psychic energy that drives a person to pleasurable thoughts and behaviors. Our life\\ninstincts, or Eros, are manifested through it and are the creative forces that sustain life. They include\\nhunger, thirst, self-preservation, and sex. In contrast, Thanatos, our death instinct, is either directed\\ninward as in the case of suicide and masochism or outward via hatred and aggression. Both types of\\ninstincts are sources of stimulation in the body and create a state of tension that is unpleasant, thereby\\nmotivating us to reduce them. Consider hunger, and the associated rumbling of our stomach, fatigue,\\nlack of energy, etc., that motivates us to find and eat food. If we are angry at someone, we may engage\\nin physical or relational aggression to alleviate this stimulation.\\n            2.3.1.2. The development of personality. Freud’s psychosexual stages of personality\\ndevelopment are listed below. Please note that a person may become fixated at any stage, meaning\\nthey become stuck, thereby affecting later development and possibly leading to abnormal functioning,\\nor psychopathology.\\nOral Stage – Beginning at birth and lasting to 24 months, the libido is focused on the mouth.1.\\nSexual tension is relieved by sucking and swallowing at first, and then later by chewing and biting\\nas baby teeth come in. Fixation is linked to a lack of confidence, argumentativeness, and sarcasm.\\nAnal Stage – Lasting from 2-3 years, the libido is focused on the anus as toilet training occurs. If2.\\nparents are too lenient, children may become messy or unorganized. If parents are too strict,\\nchildren may become obstinate, stingy, or orderly.\\nPhallic Stage – Occurring from about age 3 to 5-6 years, the libido is focused on the genitals, and3.\\nchildren develop an attachment to the parent of the opposite sex and are jealous of the same-sex\\nparent. The Oedipus complex develops in boys and results in the son falling in love with his\\nmother while fearing that his father will find out and castrate him. Meanwhile, girls fall in love\\nwith the father and fear that their mother will find out, called the Electra complex. A fixation at\\nthis stage may result in low self-esteem, feelings of worthlessness, and shyness.\\nLatency Stage – From 6-12 years of age, children lose interest in sexual behavior, so boys play4.\\nwith boys and girls with girls. Neither sex pays much attention to the opposite sex.\\nGenital Stage – Beginning at puberty, sexual impulses reawaken and unfulfilled desires from5.\\ninfancy and childhood can be satisfied during lovemaking.\\n            2.3.1.3. Dealing with anxiety. The ego has a challenging job to fulfill, balancing both the will\\nof the id and the superego, and the overwhelming anxiety and panic this creates. Ego-defense\\nmechanisms are in place to protect us from this pain but are considered maladaptive if they are\\nmisused and become our primary way of dealing with stress. They protect us from anxiety and operate\\nunconsciously by distorting reality. Defense mechanisms include the following:\\nRepression – When unacceptable ideas, wishes, desires, or memories are blocked from\\nconsciousness such as forgetting a horrific car accident that you caused. Eventually, though, it\\nmust be dealt with, or the repressed memory can cause problems later in life.\\nReaction formation – When an impulse is repressed and then expressed by its opposite. For'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n65\\nexample, you are angry with your boss but cannot lash out at him, so you are super friendly\\ninstead. Another example is having lustful thoughts about a coworker than you cannot express\\nbecause you are married, so you are extremely hateful to this person.\\nDisplacement – When we satisfy an impulse with a different object because focusing on the\\nprimary object may get us in trouble. A classic example is taking out your frustration with your\\nboss on your wife and/or kids when you get home. If you lash out at your boss, you could be fired.\\nThe substitute target is less dangerous than the primary target.\\nProjection – When we attribute threatening desires or unacceptable motives to others. An\\nexample is when we do not have the skills necessary to complete a task, but we blame the other\\nmembers of our group for being incompetent and unreliable.\\nSublimation – When we find a socially acceptable way to express a desire. If we are stressed out\\nor upset, we may go to the gym and box or lift weights. A person who desires to cut things may\\nbecome a surgeon.\\nDenial – Sometimes, life is so hard that all we can do is deny how bad it is. An example is denying\\na diagnosis of lung cancer given by your doctor.\\nIdentification – When we find someone who has found a socially acceptable way to satisfy their\\nunconscious wishes and desires, and we model that behavior.\\nRegression – When we move from a mature behavior to one that is infantile. If your significant\\nother is nagging you, you might regress by putting your hands over your ears and saying, “La la la\\nla la la la la…”\\nRationalization – When we offer well-thought-out reasons for why we did what we did, but these\\nare not the real reason. Students sometimes rationalize not doing well in a class by stating that\\nthey really are not interested in the subject or saying the instructor writes impossible-to-pass\\ntests.\\nIntellectualization – When we avoid emotion by focusing on the intellectual aspects of a\\nsituation such as ignoring the sadness we are feeling after the death of our mother by focusing on\\nplanning the funeral.\\nFor more on defense mechanisms, please visit:\\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/fulfillment-any-age/201110/the-essential-guide-defense-mechani\\nsms\\n            2.3.1.4. Psychodynamic techniques. Freud used three primary assessment techniques—free\\nassociation, transference, and dream analysis—as part of psychoanalysis, or psychoanalytic therapy, to\\nunderstand the personalities of his patients and expose repressed material. First, free association\\ninvolves the patient describing whatever comes to mind during the session. The patient continues but\\nalways reaches a point when he/she cannot or will not proceed any further. The patient might change\\nthe subject, stop talking, or lose his/her train of thought. Freud said this resistance revealed where\\nissues persisted.\\nSecond, transference is the process through which patients transfer attitudes he/she held during\\nchildhood to the therapist. They may be positive and include friendly, affectionate feelings, or negative,\\nand include hostile and angry feelings. The goal of therapy is to wean patients from their childlike\\ndependency on the therapist.\\nFinally, Freud used dream analysis to understand a person’s innermost wishes. The content of dreams'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n66\\nincludes the person’s actual retelling of the dreams, called manifest content, and the hidden or\\nsymbolic meaning called latent content. In terms of the latter, some symbols are linked to the person\\nspecifically, while others are common to all people.\\n        2.3.1.5. Evaluating psychodynamic theory. Freud’s psychodynamic theory made a lasting\\nimpact on the field of psychology but also has been criticized heavily. First, Freud made most of his\\nobservations in an unsystematic, uncontrolled way, and he relied on the case study method. Second, the\\nparticipants in his studies were not representative of the broader population. Despite Freud’s\\ngeneralization, his theory was based on only a few patients.  Third, he relied solely on the reports of his\\npatients and sought no observer reports. Fourth, it is difficult to empirically study psychodynamic\\nprinciples since most operate unconsciously. This begs the question of how we can really know that they\\nexist. Finally, psychoanalytic treatment is expensive and time consuming, and since Freud’s time, drug\\ntherapies have become more popular and successful. Still, Sigmund Freud developed useful therapeutic\\ntools for clinicians and raised awareness about the role the unconscious plays in both normal and\\nabnormal behavior.\\n \\n2.3.2. The Behavioral Model\\n            2.3.2.1. What is learning? The behavioral model concerns the cognitive process of learning,\\nwhich is any relatively permanent change in behavior due to experience and practice. Learning has two\\nmain forms – associative learning and observational learning. First, associative learning is the linking\\ntogether of information sensed from our environment. Conditioning, or a type of associative learning,\\noccurs when two separate events become connected. There are two forms: classical conditioning, or\\nlinking together two types of stimuli, and operant conditioning, or linking together a response with its\\nconsequence. Second, observational learning occurs when we learn by observing the world around\\nus.\\nWe should also note the existence of non-associative learning or when there is no linking of information\\nor observing the actions of others around you. Types include habituation, or when we simply stop\\nresponding to repetitive and harmless stimuli in our environment such as a fan running in your laptop\\nas you work on a paper, and sensitization, or when our reactions are increased due to a strong\\nstimulus, such as an individual who experienced a mugging and now panics when someone walks up\\nbehind him/her on the street.\\nBehaviorism is the school of thought associated with learning that began in 1913 with the publication of\\nJohn B. Watson’s article, “Psychology as the Behaviorist Views It,” in the journal Psychological Review\\n(Watson, 1913). Watson believed that the subject matter of psychology was to be observable behavior,\\nand to that end, psychology should focus on the prediction and control of behavior. Behaviorism was\\ndominant from 1913 to 1990 before being absorbed into mainstream psychology. It went through three\\nmajor stages – behaviorism proper under Watson and lasting from 1913-1930 (discussed as\\nclassical/respondent conditioning), neobehaviorism under Skinner and lasting from 1930-1960\\n(discussed as operant conditioning), and sociobehaviorism under Bandura and Rotter and lasting from\\n1960-1990 (discussed as social learning theory).\\n            2.3.2.2. Respondent conditioning. You have likely heard about Pavlov and his dogs, but what\\nyou may not know is that this was a discovery made accidentally. Ivan Petrovich Pavlov (1906, 1927,\\n1928), a Russian physiologist, was interested in studying digestive processes in dogs in response to'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n67\\nbeing fed meat powder. What he discovered was the dogs would salivate even before the meat powder\\nwas presented. They would salivate at the sound of a bell, footsteps in the hall, a tuning fork, or the\\npresence of a lab assistant. Pavlov realized some stimuli automatically elicited responses (such as\\nsalivating to meat powder) and other stimuli had to be paired with these automatic associations for the\\nanimal or person to respond to it (such as salivating to a bell). Armed with this stunning revelation,\\nPavlov spent the rest of his career investigating the learning phenomenon.\\nThe important thing to understand is that not all behaviors occur due to reinforcement and punishment\\nas operant conditioning says. In the case of respondent conditioning, stimuli exert complete and\\nautomatic control over some behaviors. We see this in the case of reflexes. When a doctor strikes your\\nknee with that little hammer, your leg extends out automatically. Another example is how a baby will\\nroot for a food source if the mother’s breast is placed near their mouth. And if a nipple is placed in their\\nmouth, they will also automatically suck via the sucking reflex. Humans have several of these reflexes,\\nthough not as many as other animals due to our more complicated nervous system.\\nRespondent conditioning (also called classical or Pavlovian conditioning) occurs when we link a\\npreviously neutral stimulus with a stimulus that is unlearned or inborn, called an unconditioned\\nstimulus. In respondent conditioning, learning happens in three phases: preconditioning, conditioning,\\nand postconditioning. See Figure 2.5 for an overview of Pavlov’s classic experiment.\\nPreconditioning. Notice that preconditioning has both an A and a B panel. All this stage of learning\\nsignifies is that some learning is already present. There is no need to learn it again, as in the case of\\nprimary reinforcers and punishers in operant conditioning. In Panel A, food makes a dog salivate. This\\nresponse does not need to be learned and shows the relationship between an unconditioned stimulus\\n(UCS) yielding an unconditioned response (UCR). Unconditioned means unlearned. In Panel B, we see\\nthat a neutral stimulus (NS) produces no response. Dogs do not enter the world knowing to respond to\\nthe ringing of a bell (which it hears).\\nConditioning. Conditioning is when learning occurs. By pairing a neutral stimulus and unconditioned\\nstimulus (bell and food, respectively), the dog will learn that the bell ringing (NS) signals food coming\\n(UCS) and salivate (UCR). The pairing must occur more than once so that needless pairings are not\\nlearned such as someone farting right before your food comes out and now you salivate whenever\\nsomeone farts (…at least for a while. Eventually the fact that no food comes will extinguish this reaction\\nbut still, it will be weird for a bit).\\n \\nFigure 2.5. Pavlov’s Classic Experiment'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n68\\nPostconditioning. Postconditioning, or after learning has occurred, establishes a new and not\\nnaturally occurring relationship of a conditioned stimulus (CS; previously the NS) and conditioned\\nresponse (CR; the same response). So the dog now reliably salivates at the sound of the bell because he\\nexpects that food will follow, and it does.\\nWatson and Rayner (1920) conducted one of the most famous studies in psychology. Essentially, they\\nwanted to explore “the possibility of conditioning various types of emotional response(s).” The\\nresearchers ran a series of trials in which they exposed a 9-month-old child, known as Little Albert, to a\\nwhite rat. Little Albert made no response outside of curiosity (NS–NR not shown). Panel A of Figure 2.6\\nshows the naturally occurring response to the stimulus of a loud sound. On later trials, the rat was\\npresented (NS) and followed closely by a loud sound (UCS; Panel B). After several conditioning trials,\\nthe child responded with fear to the mere presence of the white rat (Panel C).\\n \\nFigure 2.6. Learning to Fear'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n69\\nAs fears can be learned, so too they can be unlearned. Considered the follow-up to Watson and Rayner\\n(1920), Jones (1924; Figure 2.7) wanted to see if a child who learned to be afraid of white rabbits (Panel\\nB) could be conditioned to become unafraid of them. Simply, she placed the child in one end of a room\\nand then brought in the rabbit. The rabbit was far enough away so as not to cause distress. Then, Jones\\ngave the child some pleasant food (i.e., something sweet such as cookies [Panel C]; remember the\\nresponse to the food is unlearned, i.e., Panel A). The procedure in Panel C continued with the rabbit\\nbeing brought a bit closer each time until, eventually, the child did not respond with distress to the\\nrabbit (Panel D).\\n \\nFigure 2.7. Unlearning Fears\\nThis process is called counterconditioning, or the reversal of previous learning.\\nAnother respondent conditioning way to unlearn a fear is called flooding or exposing the person to the'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n70\\nmaximum level of stimulus and as nothing aversive occurs, the link between CS and UCS producing the\\nCR of fear should break, leaving the person unafraid. That is the idea, at least. So, if you were afraid of\\nclowns, you would be thrown into a room full of clowns. Hmm….\\nFinally, respondent conditioning has several properties:\\nRespondent Generalization – When many similar CSs or a broad range of CSs elicit the same\\nCR. An example is the sound of a whistle eliciting salivation much the same as a ringing bell, both\\ndetected via audition.\\nRespondent Discrimination – When a single CS or a narrow range of CSs elicits a CR, i.e.,\\nteaching the dog to respond to a specific bell and ignore the whistle. The whistle would not be\\nfollowed by food, eventually leading to….\\nRespondent Extinction – When the CS is no longer paired with the UCS. The sound of a school\\nbell ringing (new CS that was generalized) is not followed by food (UCS), and so eventually, the\\ndog stops salivating (the CR).\\nSpontaneous Recovery – When the CS elicits the CR after extinction has occurred. Eventually,\\nthe school bell will ring, making the dog salivate. If no food comes, the behavior will not continue.\\nIf food appears, the salivation response will be re-established.\\n            2.3.2.3. Operant conditioning. Influential on the development of Skinner’s operant\\nconditioning, Thorndike (1905) proposed the law of effect or the idea that if our behavior produces a\\nfavorable consequence, in the future when the same stimulus is present, we will be more likely to make\\nthe response again, expecting the same favorable consequence. Likewise, if our action leads to\\ndissatisfaction, then we will not repeat the same behavior in the future. He developed the law of effect\\nthanks to his work with a puzzle box. Cats were food deprived the night before the experimental\\nprocedure was to occur. The next morning, researchers placed a hungry cat in the puzzle box and set a\\nsmall amount of food outside the box, just close enough to be smelled. The cat could escape the box and\\nreach the food by manipulating a series of levers. Once free, the cat was allowed to eat some food\\nbefore being promptly returned to the box. With each subsequent escape and re-insertion into the box,\\nthe cat became faster at correctly manipulating the levers. This scenario demonstrates trial and error\\nlearning or making a response repeatedly if it leads to success. Thorndike also said that stimulus and\\nresponses were connected by the organism, and this led to learning. This approach to learning was\\ncalled connectionism.\\nOperant conditioning is a type of associate learning which focuses on consequences that follow a\\nresponse or behavior that we make (anything we do or say) and whether it makes a behavior more or\\nless likely to occur. This should sound much like what you just read about in terms of Thorndike’s work.\\nSkinner talked about contingencies or when one thing occurs due to another. Think of it as an If-Then\\nstatement. If I do X, then Y will happen. For operant conditioning, this means that if I make a behavior,\\nthen a specific consequence will follow. The events (response and consequence) are linked in time.\\nWhat form do these consequences take? There are two main ways they can present themselves.\\nReinforcement – Due to the consequence, a behavior/response is strengthened and more\\nlikely to occur in the future.\\nPunishment – Due to the consequence, a behavior/response is weakened and less likely to\\noccur in the future.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n71\\nReinforcement and punishment can occur as two types – positive and negative. These words have no\\naffective connotation to them, meaning they do not imply good or bad. Positive means that you are\\ngiving something – good or bad. Negative means that something is being taken away – good or bad.\\nCheck out the figure below for how these contingencies are arranged.\\n \\nFigure 2.8. Contingencies in Operant Conditioning\\nLet’s go through each:\\nPositive Punishment (PP) – If something bad or aversive is given or added, then the behavior is\\nless likely to occur in the future. If you talk back to your mother and she slaps your mouth, this is\\na PP. Your response of talking back led to the consequence of the aversive slap being given to\\nyour face. Ouch!!!\\nPositive Reinforcement (PR) – If something good is given or added, then the behavior is more\\nlikely to occur in the future. If you study hard and receive an A on your exam, you will be more\\nlikely to study hard in the future. Similarly, your parents may give you money for your stellar\\nperformance. Cha Ching!!!\\nNegative Reinforcement (NR) – This is a tough one for students to comprehend because the\\nterms seem counterintuitive, even though we experience NR all the time. NR is when something\\nbad or aversive is taken away or subtracted due to your actions, making it that you will be more\\nlikely to make the same behavior in the future when the same stimulus presents itself. For\\ninstance, what do you do if you have a headache? If you take Tylenol and the pain goes away, you\\nwill likely take Tylenol in the future when you have a headache. NR can either result in current\\nescape behavior or future avoidance behavior. What does this mean? Escape occurs when we are\\npresently experiencing an aversive event and want it to end. We make a behavior and if the\\naversive event, like the headache, goes away, we will repeat the taking of Tylenol in the future.\\nThis future action is an avoidance event. We might start to feel a headache coming on and run to\\ntake Tylenol right away. By doing so, we have removed the possibility of the aversive event\\noccurring, and this behavior demonstrates that learning has occurred.\\nNegative Punishment (NP) – This is when something good is taken away or subtracted, making'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n72\\na behavior less likely in the future. If you are late to class and your professor deducts 5 points\\nfrom your final grade (the points are something good and the loss is negative), you will hopefully\\nbe on time in all subsequent classes.\\nThe type of reinforcer or punisher we use is crucial. Some are naturally occurring, while others need to\\nbe learned. We describe these as primary and secondary reinforcers and punishers. Primary refers to\\nreinforcers and punishers that have their effect without having to be learned. Food, water, temperature,\\nand sex, for instance, are primary reinforcers, while extreme cold or hot or a punch on the arm are\\ninherently punishing. A story will illustrate the latter. When I was about eight years old, I would walk up\\nthe street in my neighborhood, saying, “I’m Chicken Little and you can’t hurt me.” Most ignored me, but\\nsome gave me the attention I was seeking, a positive reinforcer. So I kept doing it and doing it until one\\nday, another kid grew tired of hearing about my other identity and punched me in the face. The pain\\nwas enough that I never walked up and down the street echoing my identity crisis for all to hear. This\\nwas a positive punisher that did not have to be learned, and definitely not one of my finer moments in\\nlife.\\nSecondary or conditioned reinforcers and punishers are not inherently reinforcing or punishing but\\nmust be learned. An example was the attention I received for saying I was Chicken Little. Over time I\\nlearned that attention was good. Other examples of secondary reinforcers include praise, a smile,\\ngetting money for working or earning good grades, stickers on a board, points, getting to go out\\ndancing, and getting out of an exam if you are doing well in a class. Examples of secondary punishers\\ninclude a ticket for speeding, losing television or video game privileges, ridicule, or a fee for paying\\nyour rent or credit card bill late. Really, the sky is the limit with reinforcers in particular.\\nIn operant conditioning, the rule for determining when and how often we will reinforce the desired\\nbehavior is called the reinforcement schedule. Reinforcement can either occur continuously meaning\\nevery time the desired behavior is made the subject will receive some reinforcer, or\\nintermittently/partially meaning reinforcement does not occur with every behavior. Our focus will be on\\npartial/intermittent reinforcement.\\n \\nFigure 2.9. Key Components of Reinforcement Schedules'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n73\\nFigure 2.9 shows that that are two main components that make up a reinforcement schedule – when you\\nwill reinforce and what is being reinforced. In the case of when, it will be either fixed or at a set rate, or\\nvariable and at a rate that changes. In terms of what is being reinforced, we will either reinforce\\nresponses or time. These two components pair up as follows:\\nFixed Ratio schedule (FR) – With this schedule, we reinforce some set number of responses.\\nFor instance, every twenty problems (fixed) a student gets correct (ratio), the teacher gives him\\nan extra credit point. A specific behavior is being reinforced – getting problems correct. Note that\\nif we reinforce each occurrence of the behavior, the definition of continuous reinforcement, we\\ncould also describe this as an FR1 schedule. The number indicates how many responses have to\\nbe made, and in this case, it is one.\\nVariable Ratio schedule (VR) – We might decide to reinforce some varying number of\\nresponses, such as if the teacher gives him an extra credit point after finishing between 40 and 50\\ncorrect problems. This approach is useful if the student is learning the material and does not need\\nregular reinforcement. Also, since the schedule changes, the student will keep responding in the\\nabsence of reinforcement.\\nFixed Interval schedule (FI) – With a FI schedule, you will reinforce after some set amount of\\ntime. Let’s say a company wanted to hire someone to sell their product. To attract someone, they\\ncould offer to pay them $10 an hour 40 hours a week and give this money every two weeks. Crazy\\nidea, but it could work. Saying the person will be paid every indicates fixed, and two weeks is time\\nor interval. So, FI.\\nVariable Interval schedule (VI) – Finally, you could reinforce someone at some changing\\namount of time. Maybe they receive payment on Friday one week, then three weeks later on\\nMonday, then two days later on Wednesday, then eight days later on Thursday, etc. This could\\nwork, right? Not for a job, but maybe we could say we are reinforced on a VI schedule if we are.\\nFinally, four properties of operant conditioning – extinction, spontaneous recovery, stimulus\\ngeneralization, and stimulus discrimination – are important. These are the same four discussed under\\nrespondent conditioning. First, extinction is when something that we do, say, think/feel has not been\\nreinforced for some time. As you might expect, the behavior will begin to weaken and eventually stop\\nwhen this occurs. Does extinction happen as soon as the anticipated reinforcer is removed? The answer\\nis yes and no, depending on whether we are talking about continuous or partial reinforcement. With\\nwhich type of schedule would you expect a person to stop responding to immediately if reinforcement is\\nnot there? Continuous or partial?\\nThe answer is continuous. If a person is used to receiving reinforcement every time they perform a\\nparticular behavior, and then suddenly no reinforcer is delivered, he or she will cease the response\\nimmediately. Obviously then, with partial, a response continues being made for a while. Why is this?\\nThe person may think the schedule has simply changed. ‘Maybe I am not paid weekly now. Maybe it\\nchanged to biweekly and I missed the email.’ Due to this endurance, we say that intermittent or partial\\nreinforcement shows resistance to extinction, meaning the behavior does weaken, but gradually.\\nAs you might expect, if reinforcement occurs after extinction has started, the behavior will re-emerge.\\nConsider your parents for a minute. To stop some undesirable behavior you made in the past, they likely\\ntook away some privilege. I bet the bad behavior ended too. But did you ever go to your grandparent’s\\nhouse and grandma or grandpa—or worse, BOTH—took pity on you and let you play your video games\\n(or something equivalent)? I know my grandmother used to. What happened to that bad behavior that\\nhad disappeared? Did it start again and your parents could not figure out why?'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n74\\nAdditionally, you might have wondered if the person or animal will try to make the response again in\\nthe future even though it stopped being reinforced in the past.  The answer is yes, and one of two\\noutcomes is possible. First, the response is made, and nothing happens. In this case, extinction\\ncontinues. Second, the response is made, and a reinforcer is delivered. The response re-emerges.\\nConsider a rat trained to push a lever to receive a food pellet. If we stop providing the food pellets, in\\ntime, the rat will stop pushing the lever. If the rat pushes the lever again sometime in the future and\\nfood is delivered, the behavior spontaneously recovers. Hence, this phenomenon is called spontaneous\\nrecovery.\\n            2.3.2.4. Observational learning. There are times when we learn by simply watching others.\\nThis is called observational learning and is contrasted with enactive learning, which is learning by\\ndoing. There is no firsthand experience by the learner in observational learning, unlike enactive. As you\\ncan learn desirable behaviors such as watching how your father bags groceries at the grocery store (I\\ndid this and still bag the same way today), you can learn undesirable ones too. If your parents resort to\\nalcohol consumption to deal with stressors life presents, then you also might do the same. The critical\\npart is what happens to the person modeling the behavior. If my father seems genuinely happy and\\npleased with himself after bagging groceries his way, then I will be more likely to adopt this behavior. If\\nmy mother or father consumes alcohol to feel better when things are tough, and it works, then I might\\ndo the same. On the other hand, if we see a sibling constantly getting in trouble with the law, then we\\nmay not model this behavior due to the negative consequences.\\nAlbert Bandura conducted pivotal research on observational learning, and you likely already know all\\nabout it. Check out Figure 2.10 to see if you do. In Bandura’s experiment, children were first brought\\ninto a room to watch a video of an adult playing nicely or aggressively with a Bobo doll, which provided\\na model. Next, the children are placed in a room with several toys in it. The room contains a highly\\nprized toy, but they are told they cannot play with it. All other toys are allowed, including a Bobo doll.\\nChildren who watched the aggressive model behaved aggressively with the Bobo doll while those who\\nsaw the gentle model, played nice. Both groups were frustrated when deprived of the coveted toy.\\n \\nFigure 2.10. Bandura’s Classic Experiment'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n75\\nAccording to Bandura, all behaviors are learned by observing others, and we model our actions after\\ntheirs, so undesirable behaviors can be altered or relearned in the same way. Modeling techniques\\nchange behavior by having subjects observe a model in a situation that usually causes them some\\nanxiety.  By seeing the model interact nicely with the fear evoking stimulus, their fear should subside.\\nThis form of behavior therapy is widely used in clinical, business, and classroom situations. In the\\nclassroom, we might use modeling to demonstrate to a student how to do a math problem. In fact, in\\nmany college classrooms, this is exactly what the instructor does. In the business setting, a model or\\ntrainer demonstrates how to use a computer program or run a register for a new employee.\\nHowever, keep in mind that we do not model everything we see. Why? First, we cannot pay attention to\\neverything going on around us. We are more likely to model behaviors by someone who commands our\\nattention. Second, we must remember what a model does to imitate it. If a behavior is not memorable, it\\nwill not be imitated. We must try to convert what we see into action. If we are not motivated to perform\\nan observed behavior, we probably will not show what we have learned.\\n            2.3.2.5. Evaluating the behavioral model. Within the context of psychopathology, the\\nbehavioral perspective is useful because explains maladaptive behavior in terms of learning gone awry.\\nThe good thing is that what is learned can be unlearned or relearned through behavior modification,\\nthe process of changing behavior. To begin, an applied behavior analyst identifies a target behavior, or\\nbehavior to be changed, defines it, works with the client to develop goals, conducts a functional\\nassessment to understand what the undesirable behavior is, what causes it, and what maintains it. With\\nthis knowledge, a plan is developed and consists of numerous strategies to act on one or all these\\nelements – antecedent, behavior, and/or consequence. The strategies arise from all three learning\\nmodels. In terms of operant conditioning, strategies include antecedent manipulations, prompts,\\npunishment procedures, differential reinforcement, habit reversal, shaping, and programming. Flooding\\nand desensitization are typical respondent conditioning procedures used with phobias, and modeling\\narises from social learning theory and observational learning. Watson and Skinner defined behavior as\\nwhat we do or say, but later behaviorists added what we think or feel. In terms of the latter, cognitive'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n76\\nbehavior modification procedures arose after the 1960s and with the rise of cognitive psychology. This\\nled to a cognitive-behavioral perspective that combines concepts from the behavioral and cognitive\\nmodels, the latter discussed in the next section.\\nCritics of the behavioral perspective point out that it oversimplifies behavior and often ignores inner\\ndeterminants of behavior. Behaviorism has also been accused of being mechanistic and seeing people as\\nmachines. This criticism would be true of behaviorism’s first two stages, though sociobehaviorism\\nsteered away from this proposition and even fought against any mechanistic leanings of behaviorists.\\nThe greatest strength or appeal of the behavioral model is that its tenets are easily tested in the\\nlaboratory, unlike those of the psychodynamic model. Also, many treatment techniques have been\\ndeveloped and proven to be effective over the years. For example, desensitization (Wolpe, 1997)\\nteaches clients to respond calmly to fear-producing stimuli. It begins with the individual learning a\\nrelaxation technique such as diaphragmatic breathing. Next, a fear hierarchy, or list of feared objects\\nand situations, is constructed in which the individual moves from least to most feared. Finally, the\\nindividual either imagines (systematic) or experiences in real life (in-vivo) each object or scenario from\\nthe hierarchy and uses the relaxation technique while doing so. This represents the individual pairings\\nof a feared object or situation and relaxation. So, if there are 10 objects/situations in the list, the client\\nwill experience ten such pairings and eventually be able to face each without fear. Outside of phobias,\\ndesensitization has been shown to be effective in the treatment of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder\\nsymptoms (Hakimian and Souza, 2016) and limitedly with the treatment of depression when co-morbid\\nwith OCD (Masoumeh and Lancy, 2016).\\n \\n2.3.3. The Cognitive Model\\n            2.3.3.1. What is it? As noted earlier, the idea of people being machines, called mechanism,\\nwas a key feature of behaviorism and other schools of thought in psychology until about the 1960s or\\n1970s. In fact, behaviorism said psychology was to be the study of observable behavior. Any reference\\nto cognitive processes was dismissed as this was not overt, but covert according to Watson and later\\nSkinner. Of course, removing cognition from the study of psychology ignored an important part of what\\nmakes us human and separates us from the rest of the animal kingdom. Fortunately, the work of George\\nMiller, Albert Ellis, Aaron Beck, and Ulrich Neisser demonstrated the importance of cognitive abilities\\nin understanding thoughts, behaviors, and emotions, and in the case of psychopathology, show that\\npeople can create their problems by how they come to interpret events experienced in the world around\\nthem. How so?\\n            2.3.3.2. Schemas and cognitive errors. First, consider the topic of social cognition or the\\nprocess of collecting and assessing information about others. So what do we do with this information?\\nOnce collected or sensed (sensation is the cognitive process of detecting the physical energy given off\\nor emitted by physical objects), the information is sent to the brain through the neural impulse. Once in\\nthe brain, it is processed and interpreted. This is where assessing information about others comes in\\nand involves the cognitive process of perception, or adding meaning to raw sensory data. We take the\\ninformation just detected and use it to assign people to categories, or groups. For each category, we\\nhave a schema, or a set of beliefs and expectations about a group of people, presumed to apply to all\\nmembers of the group, and based on experience.\\nCan our schemas lead us astray or be false? Consider where students sit in a class. It is generally'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n77\\nunderstood that the students who sit in the front of the class are the overachievers and want to earn an\\nA in the class. Those who sit in the back of the room are underachievers who don’t care. Right? Where\\ndo you sit in class, if you are on a physical campus and not an online student? Is this correct? What\\nabout other students in the class that you know? What if you found out that a friend who sits in the front\\nrow is a C student but sits there because he cannot see the screen or board, even with corrective\\nlenses? What about your friend or acquaintance in the back? This person is an A student but does not\\nlike being right under the nose of the professor, especially if he/she tends to spit when lecturing. The\\nperson in the back could also be shy and prefer sitting there so that s/he does not need to chat with\\nothers as much. Or, they are easily distracted and sits in the back so that all stimuli are in front of\\nhim/her. Again, your schema about front row and back row students is incorrect and causes you to\\nmake certain assumptions about these individuals. This might even affect how you interact with them.\\nWould you want notes from the student in the front or back of the class?\\n            2.3.3.3. Attributions and cognitive errors. Second, consider the very interesting social\\npsychology topic attribution theory, or the idea that people are motivated to explain their own and\\nother people’s behavior by attributing causes of that behavior to personal reasons or dispositional\\nfactors that are in the person themselves or linked to some trait they have; or situational factors that\\nare linked to something outside the person. Like schemas, the attributions we make can lead us astray.\\nHow so? The fundamental attribution error occurs when we automatically assume a dispositional\\nreason for another person’s actions and ignore situational factors. In other words, we assume the\\nperson who cut us off is an idiot (dispositional) and do not consider that maybe someone in the car is\\nseverely injured and this person is rushing them to the hospital (situational). Then there is the self-\\nserving bias, which is when we attribute our success to our own efforts (dispositional) and our failures\\nto external causes (situational). Our attribution in these two cases is in error, but still, it comes to affect\\nhow we see the world and our subjective well-being.\\n            2.3.3.4. Maladaptive cognitions. Irrational thought patterns can be the basis of\\npsychopathology. Throughout this book, we will discuss several treatment strategies used to change\\nunwanted, maladaptive cognitions, whether they are present as an excess such as with paranoia,\\nsuicidal ideation, or feelings of worthlessness; or as a deficit such as with self-confidence and self-\\nefficacy. More specifically, cognitive distortions/maladaptive cognitions can take the following forms:\\nOvergeneralizing – You see a larger pattern of negatives based on one event.\\nMind Reading – Assuming others know what you are thinking without any evidence.\\nWhat if? – Asking yourself ‘what if something happens,’ without being satisfied by any of the\\nanswers.\\nBlaming – You focus on someone else as the source of your negative feelings and do not take any\\nresponsibility for changing yourself.\\nPersonalizing – Blaming yourself for adverse events rather than seeing the role that others play.\\nInability to disconfirm – Ignoring any evidence that may contradict your maladaptive cognition.\\nRegret orientation – Focusing on what you could have done better in the past rather than on\\nimproving now.\\nDichotomous thinking – Viewing people or events in all-or-nothing terms.\\n            2.3.3.5. Cognitive therapies. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI),\\ncognitive behavioral therapy “focuses on exploring relationships among a person’s thoughts, feelings\\nand behaviors. During CBT a therapist will actively work with a person to uncover unhealthy patterns of\\nthought and how they may be causing self-destructive behaviors and beliefs.” CBT attempts to identify'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n78\\nnegative or false beliefs and restructure them. They add, “Oftentimes someone being treated with CBT\\nwill have homework in between sessions where they practice replacing negative thoughts with more\\nrealistic thoughts based on prior experiences or record their negative thoughts in a journal.” For more\\non CBT, visit: https://www.nami.org/About-Mental-Illness/Treatments/Psychotherapy. Some commonly\\nused strategies include cognitive restructuring, cognitive coping skills training, and acceptance\\ntechniques.\\nFirst, you can use cognitive restructuring, also called rational restructuring, in which maladaptive\\ncognitions are replaced with more adaptive ones. To do this, the client must be aware of the distressing\\nthoughts, when they occur, and their effect on them. Next, help the client stop thinking these thoughts\\nand replace them with more rational ones. It’s a simple strategy, but an important one. Psychology\\nToday published a great article on January 21, 2013, which described four ways to change your thinking\\nthrough cognitive restructuring. Briefly, these included:\\nNotice when you are having a maladaptive cognition, such as making “negative predictions.”1.\\nFigure out what is the worst thing that could happen and what alternative outcomes are possible.\\nTrack the accuracy of the thought. If you believe focusing on a problem generates a solution, then2.\\nwrite down each time you ruminate and the result. You can generate a percentage of times you\\nruminated to the number of successful problem-solving strategies you generated.\\nBehaviorally test your thought. Try figuring out if you genuinely do not have time to go to the gym3.\\nby recording what you do each day and then look at open times of the day. Add them up and see if\\nmaking some minor, or major, adjustments to your schedule will free an hour to get in some\\nvaluable exercise.\\nExamine the evidence both for and against your thought. If you do not believe you do anything4.\\nright, list evidence of when you did not do something right and then evidence of when you did.\\nThen write a few balanced statements such as the one the article suggests, “I’ve made some\\nmistakes that I feel embarrassed about, but a lot of the time, I make good choices.”\\nThe article also suggested a few non-cognitive restructuring techniques, including mindfulness\\nmeditation and self-compassion. For more on these, visit:\\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/in-practice/201301/cognitive-restructuring\\nThe second major CBT strategy is called cognitive coping skills training. This strategy teaches social\\nskills, communication, assertiveness through direct instruction, role playing, and modeling.  For social\\nskills training, identify the appropriate social behavior such as making eye contact, saying no to a\\nrequest, or starting up a conversation with a stranger and determine whether the client is inhibited\\nfrom making this behavior due to anxiety. For communication, decide if the problem is related to\\nspeaking, listening, or both and then develop a plan for use in various interpersonal situations. Finally,\\nassertiveness training aids the client in protecting their rights and obtaining what they want from\\nothers. Those who are not assertive are often overly passive and never get what they want or are\\nunreasonably aggressive and only get what they want. Treatment starts with determining situations in\\nwhich assertiveness is lacking and developing a hierarchy of assertiveness opportunities. Least difficult\\nsituations are handled first, followed by more difficult situations, all while rehearsing and mastering all\\nthe situations present in the hierarchy. For more on these techniques, visit\\nhttp://cogbtherapy.com/cognitive-behavioral-therapy-exercises/.\\nFinally, acceptance techniques help reduce a client’s worry and anxiety. Life involves a degree of\\nuncertainty, and at times we must accept this. Techniques might include weighing the pros and cons of'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n79\\nfighting uncertainty or change. The disadvantages should outweigh the advantages and help you to end\\nthe struggle and accept what is unknown. Chances are you are already accepting the unknown in some\\nareas of life and identifying these can help you to see why it is helpful in these areas, and how you can\\napply this in more difficult areas. Finally, does uncertainty always lead to a negative end? We may think\\nso, but a review of the evidence for and against this statement will show that it does not and reduce\\nhow threatening it seems.\\n            2.3.3.6. Evaluating the cognitive model. The cognitive model made up for an apparent\\ndeficit in the behavioral model – overlooking the role cognitive processes play in our thoughts, feelings,\\nand behaviors. Right before his death, Skinner (1990) reminded psychologists that the only thing we\\ncan truly know and study was the observable. Cognitive processes cannot be empirically and reliably\\nmeasured and should be ignored. Is there merit to this view? Social desirability states that sometimes\\nparticipants do not tell us the truth about what they are thinking, feeling, or doing (or have done)\\nbecause they do not want us to think less of them or to judge them harshly if they are outside the social\\nnorm. In other words, they present themselves in a favorable light. If this is true, how can we know\\nanything about controversial matters? The person’s true intentions or thoughts and feelings are not\\nreadily available to us, or are covert, and do not make for useful empirical data. Still, cognitive-\\nbehavioral therapies have proven their efficacy for the treatment of OCD (McKay et al., 2015), perinatal\\ndepression (Sockol, 2015), insomnia (de Bruin et al., 2015), bulimia nervosa (Poulsen et al., 2014),\\nhypochondriasis (Olatunji et al., 2014), and social anxiety disorder (Leichsenring et al., 2014) to name a\\nfew. Other examples will be discussed throughout this book.\\n \\n2.3.4. The Humanistic and Existential Perspectives\\n            2.3.4.1. The humanistic perspective. The humanistic perspective, or third force psychology\\n(psychoanalysis and behaviorism being the other two forces), emerged in the 1960s and 1970s as an\\nalternative viewpoint to the largely deterministic view of personality espoused by psychoanalysis and\\nthe view of humans as machines advocated by behaviorism. Key features of the perspective include a\\nbelief in human perfectibility, personal fulfillment, valuing self-disclosure, placing feelings over\\nintellect, an emphasis on the present, and hedonism. Its key figures were Abraham Maslow, who\\nproposed the hierarchy of needs, and Carl Rogers, who we will focus on here.\\nRogers said that all people want to have positive regard from significant others in their life. When the\\nindividual is accepted as they are, they receive unconditional positive regard and become a fully\\nfunctioning person. They are open to experience, live every moment to the fullest, are creative, accepts\\nresponsibility for their decisions, do not derive their sense of self from others, strive to maximize their\\npotential, and are self-actualized. Their family and friends may disapprove of some of their actions but\\noverall, respect and love them. They then realize their worth as a person but also that they are not\\nperfect. Of course, most people do not experience this but instead are made to feel that they can only be\\nloved and respected if they meet certain standards, called conditions of worth. Hence, they experience\\nconditional positive regard. Their self-concept becomes distorted, now seen as having worth only when\\nthese significant others approve, leading to a disharmonious state and psychopathology. Individuals in\\nthis situation are unsure of what they feel, value, or need leading to dysfunction and the need for\\ntherapy. Rogers stated that the humanistic therapist should be warm, understanding, supportive,\\nrespectful, and accepting of his/her clients. This approach came to be called client-centered therapy.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n80\\n            2.3.4.2. The existential perspective. This approach stresses the need for people to re-create\\nthemselves continually and be self-aware, acknowledges that anxiety is a normal part of life, focuses on\\nfree will and self-determination, emphasizes that each person has a unique identity known only through\\nrelationships and the search for meaning, and finally, that we develop to our maximum potential.\\nAbnormal behavior arises when we avoid making choices, do not take responsibility, and fail to\\nactualize our full potential. Existential therapy is used to treat substance abuse, “excessive anxiety,\\napathy, alienation, nihilism, avoidance, shame, addiction, despair, depression, guilt, anger, rage,\\nresentment, embitterment, purposelessness, psychosis, and violence. They also focus on life-enhancing\\nexperiences like relationships, love, caring, commitment, courage, creativity, power, will, presence,\\nspirituality, individuation, self-actualization, authenticity, acceptance, transcendence, and awe.” For\\nmore information, please visit: https://www.psychologytoday.com/therapy-types/existential-therapy\\n            2.3.4.3. Evaluating the humanistic and existential perspectives. The biggest criticism of\\nthese models is that the concepts are abstract and fuzzy and so very difficult to research. Rogers did try\\nto investigate his propositions scientifically, but most other humanistic-existential psychologists\\nrejected the use of the scientific method.  They also have not developed much in the way of theory, and\\nthe perspectives tend to work best with people suffering from adjustment issues and not as well with\\nsevere mental illness. The perspectives do offer hope to people suffering tragedy by asserting that we\\ncontrol our destiny and can make our own choices.\\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nAccording to Freud, consciousness had three levels (consciousness, preconscious, and the\\nunconscious), personality had three parts (the id, ego, and superego), personality developed over\\nfive stages (oral, anal, phallic, latency, and genital), there are ten defense mechanisms to protect\\nthe ego such as repression and sublimation, and finally three assessment techniques (free\\nassociation, transference, and dream analysis) could be used to understand the personalities of\\nhis patients and expose repressed material.\\nThe behavioral model concerns the cognitive process of learning, which is any relatively\\npermanent change in behavior due to experience and practice and has two main forms –\\nassociative learning to include classical and operant conditioning and observational learning.\\nRespondent conditioning (also called classical or Pavlovian conditioning) occurs when we link a\\npreviously neutral stimulus with a stimulus that is unlearned or inborn, called an unconditioned\\nstimulus.\\nOperant conditioning is a type of associate learning which focuses on consequences that follow a\\nresponse or behavior that we make (anything we do, say, or think/feel) and whether it makes a\\nbehavior more or less likely to occur.\\nObservational learning is learning by watching others and modeling techniques change behavior\\nby having subjects observe a model in a situation that usually causes them some anxiety.\\nThe cognitive model focuses on schemas, cognitive errors, attributions, and maladaptive\\ncognitions and offers strategies such as CBT, cognitive restructuring, cognitive coping skills\\ntraining, and acceptance.\\nThe humanistic perspective focuses on positive regard, conditions of worth, and the fully\\nfunctioning person while the existential perspective stresses the need for people to re-create\\nthemselves continually and be self-aware, acknowledges that anxiety is a normal part of life,'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n82\\nLow socioeconomic status has been linked to higher rates of mental and physical illness (Ng, Muntaner,\\nChung, & Eaton, 2014) due to persistent concern over unemployment or under-employment, low wages,\\nlack of health insurance, no savings, and the inability to put food on the table, which then leads to\\nfeeling hopeless, helpless, and dependency on others. This situation places considerable stress on an\\nindividual and can lead to higher rates of anxiety disorders and depression. Borderline personality\\ndisorder has also been found to be higher in people in low-income brackets (Tomko et al., 2012) and\\ngroup differences for personality disorders have been found between African and European Americans\\n(Ryder, Sunohara, and Kirmayer, 2015).\\n \\n2.4.2. Gender Factors\\nGender plays an important, though at times, unclear role in mental illness. Gender is not a cause of\\nmental illness, though differing demands placed on males and females by society and their culture can\\ninfluence the development and course of a disorder. Consider the following:\\nRates of eating disorders are higher among women than men, though both genders are affected.\\nIn the case of men, muscle dysphoria is of concern and is characterized by extreme concern over\\nbeing more muscular.\\nOCD has an earlier age of onset in girls than boys, with most people being diagnosed by age 19.\\nFemales are at higher risk for developing an anxiety disorder than men.\\nADHD is more common in males than females, though females are more likely to have inattention\\nissues.\\nBoys are more likely to be diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder.\\nDepression occurs with greater frequency in women than men.\\nWomen are more likely to develop PTSD compared to men.\\nRates of SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder) are four times greater in women than men.\\nInterestingly, younger adults are more likely to develop SAD than older adults.\\n \\nConsider this…\\nIn relation to men: “While mental illnesses affect both men and women, the prevalence of mental\\nillnesses in men is often lower than women. Men with mental illnesses are also less likely to have\\nreceived mental health treatment than women in the past year. However, men are more likely to die by\\nsuicide than women, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Recognizing the\\nsigns that you or someone you love may have a mental disorder is the first step toward getting\\ntreatment.

When it comes to other\\nmental disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, research has not found differences in the\\nrates at which men and women experience these illnesses. But women may experience these illnesses\\ndifferently – certain symptoms may be more common in women than in men, and the course of the\\nillness can be affected by the sex of the individual. Researchers are only now beginning to tease apart\\nthe various biological and psychosocial factors that may impact the mental health of both women and\\nmen.”\\nhttps://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/women-and-mental-health/index.shtml\\n \\n2.4.3. Environmental Factors\\nEnvironmental factors also play a role in the development of mental illness. How so?\\nIn the case of borderline personality disorder, many people report experiencing traumatic life\\nevents such as abandonment, abuse, unstable relationships or hostility, and adversity during\\nchildhood.\\nCigarette smoking, alcohol use, and drug use during pregnancy are risk factors for ADHD.\\nDivorce or the death of a spouse can lead to anxiety disorders.\\nTrauma, stress, and other extreme stressors are predictive of depression.\\nMalnutrition before birth, exposure to viruses, and other psychosocial factors are potential causes\\nof schizophrenia.\\nSAD occurs with greater frequency for those living far north or south from the equator (Melrose,\\n2015). Horowitz (2008) found that rates of SAD are just 1% for those living in Florida while 9% of\\nAlaskans are diagnosed with the disorder.\\nSource: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/index.shtml\\n \\n2.4.4. Multicultural Factors\\nRacial, ethnic, and cultural factors are also relevant to understanding the development and course of\\nmental illness. Multicultural psychologists assert that both normal behavior and abnormal behavior\\nneed to be understood in the context of the individual’s unique culture and the group’s value system.\\nRacial and ethnic minorities must contend with prejudice, discrimination, racism, economic hardships,\\netc. as part of their daily life and this can lead to disordered behavior (Lo & Cheng, 2014; Jones, Cross,\\n& DeFour, 2007; Satcher, 2001), though some research suggests that ethnic identity can buffer against\\nthese stressors and protect mental health (Mossakowski, 2003). To address this unique factor, culture-\\nsensitive therapies have been developed and include increasing the therapist’s awareness of cultural\\nvalues, hardships, stressors, and/or prejudices faced by their client; the identification of suppressed\\nanger and pain; and raising the client’s self-worth (Prochaska & Norcross, 2013). These therapies have\\nproven efficacy for the treatment of depression (Kalibatseva & Leong, 2014) and schizophrenia (Naeem\\net al., 2015).'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n86\\n3.1.1. What is Clinical Assessment?\\nFor a mental health professional to be able to effectively help treat a client and know that the treatment\\nselected worked (or is working), they first must engage in the clinical assessment of the client, or\\ncollecting information and drawing conclusions through the use of observation, psychological tests,\\nneurological tests, and interviews to determine the person’s problem and the presenting symptoms.\\nThis collection of information involves learning about the client’s skills, abilities, personality\\ncharacteristics, cognitive and emotional functioning, the social context in terms of environmental\\nstressors that are faced, and cultural factors particular to them such as their language or ethnicity.\\nClinical assessment is not just conducted at the beginning of the process of seeking help but throughout\\nthe process. Why is that?\\nConsider this. First, we need to determine if a treatment is even needed. By having a clear accounting\\nof the person’s symptoms and how they affect daily functioning, we can decide to what extent the\\nindividual is adversely affected. Assuming a treatment is needed, our second reason to engage in\\nclinical assessment will be to determine what treatment will work best. As you will see later in this\\nmodule, there are numerous approaches to treatment.  These include Behavior Therapy, Cognitive and\\nCognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Humanistic-Experiential Therapies, Psychodynamic Therapies,\\nCouples and Family Therapy, and biological treatments (psychopharmacology). Of course, for any\\nmental disorder, some of the aforementioned therapies will have greater efficacy than others. Even if\\nseveral can work well, it does not mean a particular therapy will work well for that specific client.\\nAssessment can help figure this out. Finally, we need to know if the treatment we employed worked.\\nThis will involve measuring before any treatment is used and then measuring the behavior while the\\ntreatment is in place. We will even want to measure after the treatment ends to make sure symptoms of\\nthe disorder do not return. Knowing what the person’s baselines are for different aspects of\\npsychological functioning will help us to see when improvement occurs.\\nIn recap, obtaining the baselines happens in the beginning, implementing the treatment plan that is\\nagreed upon happens more so in the middle, and then making sure the treatment produces the desired\\noutcome occurs at the end. It should be clear from this discussion that clinical assessment is an ongoing\\nprocess.\\n \\n3.1.2. Key Concepts in Assessment\\nThe assessment process involves three critical concepts – reliability, validity, and standardization. These\\nthree are important to science in general. First, we want the assessment to be reliable or consistent.\\nOutside of clinical assessment, when our car has an issue and we take it to the mechanic, we want to\\nmake sure that what one mechanic says is wrong with our car is the same as what another says, or even\\ntwo others. If not, the measurement tools they use to assess cars are flawed. The same is true of a\\npatient who is suffering from a mental disorder. If one mental health professional says the person\\nsuffers from major depressive disorder and another says the issue is borderline personality disorder,\\nthen there is an issue with the assessment tool being used. Ensuring that two different raters are\\nconsistent in their assessment of patients is called interrater reliability. Another type of reliability\\noccurs when a person takes a test one day, and then the same test on another day. We would expect the\\nperson’s answers to be consistent, which is called test-retest reliability. For example, let’s say the\\nperson takes the MMPI on Tuesday and then the same test on Friday. Unless something miraculous or'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n87\\ntragic happened over the two days in between tests, the scores on the MMPI should be nearly identical\\nto one another. What does identical mean? The score at test and the score at retest are correlated with\\none another. If the test is reliable, the correlation should be very high (remember, a correlation goes\\nfrom -1.00 to +1.00, and positive means as one score goes up, so does the other, so the correlation for\\nthe two tests should be high on the positive side).\\nIn addition to reliability, we want to make sure the test measures what it says it measures. This is called\\nvalidity. Let’s say a new test is developed to measure symptoms of depression. It is compared against\\nan existing and proven test, such as the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).  If the new test measures\\ndepression, then the scores on it should be highly comparable to the ones obtained by the BDI. This is\\ncalled concurrent or descriptive validity. We might even ask if an assessment tool looks valid. If we\\nanswer yes, then it has face validity, though it should be noted that this is not based on any statistical or\\nevidence-based method of assessing validity. An example would be a personality test that asks about\\nhow people behave in certain situations. Therefore, it seems to measure personality, or we have an\\noverall feeling that it measures what we expect it to measure.\\nPredictive validity is when a tool accurately predicts what will happen in the future. Let’s say we want\\nto tell if a high school student will do well in college. We might create a national exam to test needed\\nskills and call it something like the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT). We would have high school students\\ntake it by their senior year and then wait until they are in college for a few years and see how they are\\ndoing. If they did well on the SAT, we would expect that at that point, they should be doing well in\\ncollege. If so, then the SAT accurately predicts college success. The same would be true of a test such\\nas the Graduate Record Exam (GRE) and its ability to predict graduate school performance.\\nFinally, we want to make sure that the experience one patient has when taking a test or being assessed\\nis the same as another patient taking the test the same day or on a different day, and with either the\\nsame tester or another tester. This is accomplished with the use of clearly laid out rules, norms, and/or\\nprocedures, and is called standardization. Equally important is that mental health professionals\\ninterpret the results of the testing in the same way, or otherwise, it will be unclear what the meaning of\\na specific score is.\\n \\n3.1.3. Methods of Assessment\\nSo how do we assess patients in our care? We will discuss observation, psychological tests, neurological\\ntests, the clinical interview, and a few others in this section.\\n            3.1.3.1. Observation. In Section 1.5.2.1 we talked about two types of observation –\\nnaturalistic, or observing the person or animal in their environment, and laboratory, or observing the\\norganism in a more controlled or artificial setting where the experimenter can use sophisticated\\nequipment and videotape the session to examine it later. One-way mirrors can also be used. A limitation\\nof this method is that the process of recording a behavior causes the behavior to change, called\\nreactivity. Have you ever noticed someone staring at you while you sat and ate your lunch? If you have,\\nwhat did you do? Did you change your behavior? Did you become self-conscious? Likely yes, and this is\\nan example of reactivity. Another issue is that the behavior made in one situation may not be made in\\nother situations, such as your significant other only acting out at the football game and not at home.\\nThis form of validity is called cross-sectional validity. We also need our raters to observe and record\\nbehavior in the same way or to have high inter-rater reliability.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n88\\n            3.1.3.2. The clinical interview. A clinical interview is a face-to-face encounter between a\\nmental health professional and a patient in which the former observes the latter and gathers data about\\nthe person’s behavior, attitudes, current situation, personality, and life history. The interview may be\\nunstructured in which open-ended questions are asked, structured in which a specific set of questions\\naccording to an interview schedule are asked, or semi-structured, in which there is a pre-set list of\\nquestions, but clinicians can follow up on specific issues that catch their attention. A mental status\\nexamination is used to organize the information collected during the interview and systematically\\nevaluates the patient through a series of questions assessing appearance and behavior. The latter\\nincludes grooming and body posture, thought processes and content to include disorganized speech or\\nthought and false beliefs, mood and affect such that whether the person feels hopeless or elated,\\nintellectual functioning to include speech and memory, and awareness of surroundings to include where\\nthe person is and what the day and time are. The exam covers areas not normally part of the interview\\nand allows the mental health professional to determine which areas need to be examined further. The\\nlimitation of the interview is that it lacks reliability, especially in the case of the unstructured interview.\\n            3.1.3.3. Psychological tests and inventories. Psychological tests assess the client’s\\npersonality, social skills, cognitive abilities, emotions, behavioral responses, or interests. They can be\\nadministered either individually or to groups in paper or oral fashion. Projective tests consist of simple\\nambiguous stimuli that can elicit an unlimited number of responses. They include the Rorschach or\\ninkblot test and the Thematic Apperception Test which asks the individual to write a complete story\\nabout each of 20 cards shown to them and give details about what led up to the scene depicted, what\\nthe characters are thinking, what they are doing, and what the outcome will be. From the response, the\\nclinician gains perspective on the patient’s worries, needs, emotions, conflicts, and the individual\\nalways connects with one of the people on the card.  Another projective test is the sentence completion\\ntest and asks individuals to finish an incomplete sentence. Examples include ‘My mother…’ or ‘I hope…’\\nPersonality inventories ask clients to state whether each item in a long list of statements applies to\\nthem, and could ask about feelings, behaviors, or beliefs. Examples include the MMPI or Minnesota\\nMultiphasic Personality Inventory and the NEO-PI-R, which is a concise measure of the five major\\ndomains of personality – Neuroticism, Extroversion, Openness, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness.\\nSix facets define each of the five domains, and the measure assesses emotional, interpersonal,\\nexperimental, attitudinal, and motivational styles (Costa & McCrae, 1992). These inventories have the\\nadvantage of being easy to administer by either a professional or the individual taking it, are\\nstandardized, objectively scored, and can be completed electronically or by hand. That said, personality\\ncannot be directly assessed, and so you do not ever completely know the individual.\\n            3.1.3.4. Neurological tests. Neurological tests are used to diagnose cognitive impairments\\ncaused by brain damage due to tumors, infections, or head injuries; or changes in brain activity.\\nPositron Emission Tomography or PET is used to study the brain’s chemistry. It begins by injecting the\\npatient with a radionuclide that collects in the brain and then having them lie on a scanning table while\\na ring-shaped machine is positioned over their head. Images are produced that yield information about\\nthe functioning of the brain. Magnetic Resonance Imaging or MRI provides 3D images of the brain or\\nother body structures using magnetic fields and computers. It can detect brain and spinal cord tumors\\nor nervous system disorders such as multiple sclerosis. Finally, computed tomography or the CT scan\\ninvolves taking X-rays of the brain at different angles and is used to diagnose brain damage caused by\\nhead injuries or brain tumors.\\n            3.1.3.5. Physical examination. Many mental health professionals recommend the patient see'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n89\\ntheir family physician for a physical examination, which is much like a check-up. Why is that? Some\\norganic conditions, such as hyperthyroidism or hormonal irregularities, manifest behavioral symptoms\\nthat are like mental disorders. Ruling out such conditions can save costly therapy or surgery.\\n            3.1.3.6. Behavioral assessment. Within the realm of behavior modification and applied\\nbehavior analysis, we talk about what is called behavioral assessment, which is the measurement of a\\ntarget behavior. The target behavior is whatever behavior we want to change, and it can be in excess\\nand needing to be reduced, or in a deficit state and needing to be increased. During the behavioral\\nassessment we learn about the ABCs of behavior in which Antecedents are the environmental events\\nor stimuli that trigger a behavior; Behaviors are what the person does, says, thinks/feels; and\\nConsequences are the outcome of a behavior that either encourages it to be made again in the future\\nor discourages its future occurrence. Though we might try to change another person’s behavior using\\nbehavior modification, we can also change our own behavior, which is called self-modification. The\\nperson does their own measuring and recording of the ABCs, which is called self-monitoring. In the\\ncontext of psychopathology, behavior modification can be useful in treating phobias, reducing habit\\ndisorders, and ridding the person of maladaptive cognitions.\\n            3.1.3.7. Intelligence tests. Intelligence testing determines the patient’s level of cognitive\\nfunctioning and consists of a series of tasks asking the patient to use both verbal and nonverbal skills.\\nAn example is the Stanford-Binet Intelligence test, which assesses fluid reasoning, knowledge,\\nquantitative reasoning, visual-spatial processing, and working memory. Intelligence tests have been\\ncriticized for not predicting future behaviors such as achievement and reflecting social or cultural\\nfactors/biases and not actual intelligence. Also, can we really assess intelligence through one\\ndimension, or are there multiple dimensions?\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nClinical assessment is the collecting of information and drawing conclusions through the use of\\nobservation, psychological tests, neurological tests, and interviews.\\nReliability refers to consistency in measurement and can take the form of interrater and test-\\nretest reliability.\\nValidity is when we ensure the test measures what it says it measures and takes the forms of\\nconcurrent or descriptive, face, and predictive validity.\\nStandardization is all the clearly laid out rules, norms, and/or procedures to ensure the\\nexperience each participant has is the same.\\nPatients are assessed through observation, psychological tests, neurological tests, and the clinical\\ninterview, all with their own strengths and limitations.\\n \\nSection 3.1 Review Questions\\nWhat does it mean that clinical assessment is an ongoing process?1.\\nDefine and exemplify reliability, validity, and standardization.2.'),\n",

Clinical Diagnosis and Classification Systems\\nBefore starting any type of treatment, the client/patient must be clearly diagnosed with a mental\\ndisorder. Clinical diagnosis is the process of using assessment data to determine if the pattern of\\nsymptoms the person presents with is consistent with the diagnostic criteria for a specific mental\\ndisorder outlined in an established classification system such as the DSM-5-TR or ICD-11 (both will be\\ndescribed shortly). Any diagnosis should have clinical utility, meaning it aids the mental health\\nprofessional in determining prognosis, the treatment plan, and possible outcomes of treatment (APA,\\n2022). Receiving a diagnosis does not necessarily mean the person requires treatment. This decision is\\nmade based upon how severe the symptoms are, level of distress caused by the symptoms, symptom\\nsalience such as expressing suicidal ideation, risks and benefits of treatment, disability, and other\\nfactors (APA, 2022). Likewise, a patient may not meet the full criteria for a diagnosis but demonstrate a\\nclear need for treatment or care, nonetheless. As stated in the DSM, “The fact that some individuals do\\nnot show all symptoms indicative of a diagnosis should not be used to justify limiting their access to\\nappropriate care” (APA, 2022).\\nSymptoms that cluster together regularly are called a syndrome. If they also follow the same,\\npredictable course, we say that they are characteristic of a specific disorder.  Classification systems\\nprovide mental health professionals with an agreed-upon list of disorders falling into distinct categories\\nfor which there are clear descriptions and criteria for making a diagnosis. Distinct is the keyword here.\\nPeople suffering from delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking (speech), grossly disorganized or\\nabnormal motor behavior, and/or negative symptoms are different from people presenting with a\\nprimary clinical deficit in cognitive functioning that is not developmental but acquired (i.e., they have\\nshown a decline in cognitive functioning over time). The former suffers from a schizophrenia spectrum'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n91\\ndisorder while the latter suffers from a neurocognitive disorder (NCD). The latter can be further\\ndistinguished from neurodevelopmental disorders which manifest early in development and involve\\ndevelopmental deficits that cause impairments in social, personal, academic, or occupational\\nfunctioning (APA, 2022). These three disorder groups or categories can be clearly distinguished from\\none another. Classification systems also permit the gathering of statistics to determine incidence and\\nprevalence rates and conform to the requirements of insurance companies for the payment of claims.\\nThe most widely used classification system in the United States is the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual\\nof Mental Disorders (DSM) which is a “medical classification of disorders and as such serves as a\\nhistorically determined cognitive schema imposed on clinical and scientific information to increase its\\ncomprehensibility and utility. The classification of disorders (the way in which disorders are grouped)\\nprovides a high-level organization for the manual” (APA, 2022, pg. 11). The DSM is currently in its 5th\\nedition Text-Revision (DSM-5-TR) and is produced by the American Psychiatric Association (APA, 2022).\\nAlternatively, the World Health Organization (WHO) publishes the International Statistical\\nClassification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) currently in its 11th edition. We will begin\\nby discussing the DSM and then move to the ICD.\\n \\n 3.2.2. The DSM Classification System\\n            3.2.2.1. A brief history of the DSM. The DSM-5 was published in 2013 and took the place of\\nthe DSM IV-TR (TR means Text Revision; published in 2000). In March 2022, a Text-Revision was\\npublished for the DSM-5, making it the DSM-5-TR.\\nThe history of the DSM goes back to 1952 when the American Psychiatric Association published the\\nfirst edition of the DSM which was “…the first official manual of mental disorders to contain a glossary\\nof descriptions of the diagnostic categories” (APA, 2022, p. 5). The DSM evolved through four major\\neditions after World War II into a diagnostic classification system to be used by psychiatrists and\\nphysicians, but also other mental health professionals. The Herculean task of revising the DSM began in\\n1999 when the APA embarked upon an evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of the DSM in\\ncoordination with the World Health Organization (WHO) Division of Mental Health, the World\\nPsychiatric Association, and the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). This collaboration resulted\\nin the publication of a monograph in 2002 called A Research Agenda for DSM-V. From 2003 to 2008,\\nthe APA, WHO, NIMH, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), and the National Institute on\\nAlcoholism and Alcohol Abuse (NIAAA) convened 13 international DSM-5 research planning conferences\\n“to review the world literature in specific diagnostic areas to prepare for revisions in developing both\\nDSM-5 and the International Classification of Disease, 11th Revision (ICD-11)” (APA, 2022, pg. 6).\\nAfter the naming of a DSM-5 Task Force Chair and Vice-Chair in 2006, task force members were\\nselected and approved by 2007, and workgroup members were approved in 2008. An intensive 6-year\\nprocess of “conducting literature reviews and secondary analyses, publishing research reports in\\nscientific journals, developing draft diagnostic criteria, posting preliminary drafts on the DSM-5 website\\nfor public comment, presenting preliminary findings at professional meetings, performing field trials,\\nand revisiting criteria and text” was undertaken (APA, 2022, pg. 7). The process involved physicians,\\npsychologists, social workers, epidemiologists, neuroscientists, nurses, counselors, and statisticians, all\\nwho aided in the development and testing of DSM-5 while individuals with mental disorders, families of\\nthose with a mental disorder, consumer groups, lawyers, and advocacy groups provided feedback on the'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n92\\nmental disorders contained in the book. Additionally, disorders with low clinical utility and weak validity\\nwere considered for deletion while “Conditions for Future Study” were placed in Section 3 and\\n“contingent on the amount of empirical evidence generated on the proposed diagnosis, diagnostic\\nreliability or validity, presence of clear clinical need, and potential benefit in advancing research” (APA,\\n2022, pg. 7).\\n            3.2.2.2. The DSM-5 text revision process. In the spring 2019, APA started work on the Text-\\nRevision for the DSM-5. This involved more than 200 experts who were asked to conduct literature\\nreviews of the past 10 years and to review the text to identify any material that was out-of-date. Experts\\nwere divided into 20 disorder review groups, each with its own section editor. Four cross-cutting review\\ngroups to include Culture, Sex and Gender, Suicide, and Forensic, reviewed each chapter and focused\\non material involving their specific expertise. The text was also reviewed by an Ethnoracial Equity and\\nInclusion work group whose task was to “ensure appropriate attention to risk factors such as racism\\nand discrimination and the use of nonstigmatizing language” (APA, 2022, pg. 11).\\nAs such, the DSM-5-TR “is committed to the use of language that challenges the view that races are\\ndiscrete and natural entities” (APA, 2022, pg. 18). Some of changes include:\\nUse of racialized instead of racial to indicate the socially constructed nature of race\\nEthnoracial is used to denote U.S. Census categories such as Hispanic, African American, or\\nWhite\\nLatinx is used in place of Latino or Latina to promote gender-inclusive terminology\\nThe term Caucasian is omitted since it is “based on obsolete and erroneous views about the\\ngeographic origin of a prototypical pan-European ethnicity” (pg. 18)\\nTo avoid perpetuating social hierarchies, the terms minority and non-White are avoided since they\\ndescribe social groups in relation to a racialized “majority”\\nThe terms cultural contexts and cultural backgrounds are preferred to culture which is only used\\nto refer to a “heterogeneity of cultural views and practices within societies” (pg. 18)\\nThe inclusion of data on specific ethnoracial groups only when “existing research documented\\nreliable estimates based on representative samples.” This led to limited inclusion of data on\\nNative Americans since data from nonrepresentative samples may be misleading.\\nThe use of gender differences or “women and men” or “boys and girls” since much of the\\ninformation on the expressions of mental disorders in women and men is based on self-identified\\ngender.\\nInclusion of a new section for each diagnosis providing information about suicidal thoughts or\\nbehavior associated with that diagnosis.\\n            3.2.2.3. Elements of a diagnosis. The DSM-5-TR states that the following make up the key\\nelements of a diagnosis (APA, 2022):\\nDiagnostic Criteria and Descriptors – Diagnostic criteria are the guidelines for making a diagnosis\\nand should be informed by clinical judgment. When the full criteria are met, mental health\\nprofessionals can add severity and course specifiers to indicate the patient’s current presentation.\\nIf the full criteria are not met, designators such as “other specified” or “unspecified” can be used.\\nIf applicable, an indication of severity (mild, moderate, severe, or extreme), descriptive features,\\nand course (type of remission – partial or full – or recurrent) can be provided with the diagnosis.\\nThe final diagnosis is based on the clinical interview, text descriptions, criteria, and clinical\\njudgment.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n93\\nSubtypes and Specifiers – Subtypes denote “mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive\\nphenomenological subgroupings within a diagnosis” (APA, 2022, pg. 22). For example, non-rapid\\neye movement (NREM) sleep arousal disorders can have either a sleepwalking or sleep terror\\ntype. Enuresis is nocturnal-only, diurnal-only, or both. Specifiers are not mutually exclusive or\\njointly exhaustive and so more than one specifier can be given. For instance, binge eating\\ndisorder has remission and severity specifiers. Somatic symptom disorder has a specifier for\\nseverity, if with predominant pain, and/or if persistent. Again, the fundamental distinction\\nbetween subtypes and specifiers is that there can be only one subtype but multiple specifiers. As\\nthe DSM-5-TR says, “Specifiers and subtypes provide an opportunity to define a more\\nhomogeneous subgrouping of individuals with the disorder who share certain features… and to\\nconvey information that is relevant to the management of the individual’s disorder” (pg. 22).\\nPrinciple Diagnosis – A principal diagnosis is used when more than one diagnosis is given for an\\nindividual. It is the reason for the admission in an inpatient setting or the basis for a visit\\nresulting in ambulatory care medical services in outpatient settings.

The ICD-11\\nIn 1893, the International Statistical Institute adopted the International List of Causes of Death which\\nwas the first international classification edition. The World Health Organization was entrusted with the\\ndevelopment of the ICD in 1948 and published the 6th version (ICD-6). The ICD-11 went into effect\\nJanuary 1, 2022, though it was adopted in May 2019. The WHO states:\\nICD serves a broad range of uses globally and provides critical knowledge on the extent, causes and\\nconsequences of human disease and death worldwide via data that is reported and coded with the ICD.\\nClinical terms coded with ICD are the main basis for health recording and statistics on disease in\\nprimary, secondary and tertiary care, as well as on cause of death certificates. These data and statistics\\nsupport payment systems, service planning, administration of quality and safety, and health services\\nresearch. Diagnostic guidance linked to categories of ICD also standardizes data collection and enables\\nlarge scale research.\\nAs a classification system, it “allows the systematic recording, analysis, interpretation and comparison\\nof mortality and morbidity data collected in different countries or regions and at different times.” As\\nwell, it “ensures semantic interoperability and reusability of recorded data for the different use cases\\nbeyond mere health statistics, including decision support, resource allocation, reimbursement,\\nguidelines and more.”\\nSource: http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/\\nThe ICD lists many types of diseases and disorders to include Chapter 06: Mental, Behavioral, or\\nNeurodevelopmental Disorders.

Harmonization of DSM-5-TR and ICD-11\\nAccording to the DSM-5-TR, there is an effort to harmonize the two classification systems: 1) for a more\\naccurate collection of national health statistics and design of clinical trials aimed at developing new\\ntreatments, 2) to increase the ability to replicate scientific findings across national boundaries, and 3)\\nto rectify the issue of DSM-IV and ICD-10 diagnoses not agreeing (APA, 2022, pg. 13). Complete\\nharmonization of the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria with the ICD-11 disorder definitions has not occurred\\ndue to differences in timing. The DSM-5 developmental effort was several years ahead of the ICD-11\\nrevision process. Despite this, some improvement in harmonization did occur as many ICD-11 working\\ngroup members had participated in the development of the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria and all ICD-11\\nwork groups were given instructions to review the DSM-5 criteria sets and make them as similar as\\npossible (unless there was a legitimate reason not to). This has led to the ICD and DSM being closer\\nthan at any time since DSM-II and ICD-8 (APA, 2022).\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nClinical diagnosis is the process of using assessment data to determine if the pattern of symptoms\\nthe person presents with is consistent with the diagnostic criteria for a specific mental disorder\\noutlined in an established classification system such as the DSM-5-TR or ICD-11.\\nClassification systems provide mental health professionals with an agreed-upon list of disorders\\nfalling into distinct categories for which there are clear descriptions and criteria for making a\\ndiagnosis.\\nElements of a diagnosis in the DSM include the diagnostic criteria and descriptors, subtypes and\\nspecifiers, the principle diagnosis, and a provisional diagnosis.\\n \\nSection 3.2 Review Questions\\nWhat is clinical diagnosis?1.\\nWhat is a classification system and what are the two main ones used today?2.\\nOutline the diagnostic categories used in the DSM-5-TR.3.'),\n",

Treatment of Mental Disorders – An Overview\\n \\nSection Learning Objectives\\nClarify reasons why an individual may need to seek treatment.\\nCritique myths about psychotherapy.\\n \\n3.3.1. Seeking Treatment\\n            3.3.1.1. Who seeks treatment? Would you describe the people who seek treatment as being\\non the brink, crazy, or desperate? Or can the ordinary Joe in need of advice seek out mental health\\ncounseling? The answer is that anyone can. David Sack, M.D. (2013) writes in the article 5 Signs Its\\nTime to Seek Therapy, published in Psychology Today, that “most people can benefit from therapy at\\nleast some point in their lives,” and though the signs you need to seek help are obvious at times, we\\noften try “to sustain [our] busy life until it sets in that life has become unmanageable.” So, when should\\nwe seek help? First, if we feel sad, angry, or not like ourselves. We might be withdrawing from friends\\nand families or sleeping more or less than we usually do. Second, if we are abusing drugs, alcohol, food,\\nor sex to deal with life’s problems. In this case, our coping skills may need some work. Third, in\\ninstances when we have lost a loved one or something else important to us, whether due to death or\\ndivorce, the grief may be too much to process. Fourth, a traumatic event may have occurred, such as\\nabuse, a crime, an accident, chronic illness, or rape. Finally, if you have stopped doing the things you\\nenjoy the most. Sack (2013) says, “If you decide that therapy is worth a try, it doesn’t mean you’re in for\\na lifetime of head shrinking.” A 2001 study in the Journal of Counseling Psychology found that most\\npeople feel better within seven to 10 visits. In another study, published in 2006 in the Journal of\\nConsulting and Clinical Psychology, 88% of therapy-goers reported improvements after just one\\nsession.”\\nFor more on this article, please visit:\\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/where-science-meets-the-steps/201303/5-signs-its-time-seek-ther\\napy\\n            3.3.1.2. When friends, family, and self-healing are not enough. If you are experiencing\\nany of the aforementioned issues, you should seek help. Instead of facing the potential stigma of talking\\nto a mental health professional, many people think that talking through their problems with friends or\\nfamily is just as good. Though you will ultimately need these people to see you through your recovery,\\nthey do not have the training and years of experience that a psychologist or similar professional has.\\n“Psychologists can recognize behavior or thought patterns objectively, more so than those closest to you\\nwho may have stopped noticing — or maybe never noticed. A psychologist might offer remarks or\\nobservations similar to those in your existing relationships, but their help may be more effective due to\\ntheir timing, focus, or your trust in their neutral stance”\\n(http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/psychotherapy-myths.aspx). You also should not wait to recover on your\\nown. It is not a failure to admit you need help, and there could be a biological issue that makes it almost'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n98\\nimpossible to heal yourself.\\n            3.3.1.3. What exactly is psychotherapy? According to the APA, in psychotherapy\\n“psychologists apply scientifically validated procedures to help people develop healthier, more effective\\nhabits.” Several different approaches can be utilized to include behavior, cognitive and cognitive-\\nbehavior, humanistic-experiential, psychodynamic, couples and family, and biological treatments.\\n            3.3.1.4. The client-therapist relationship. What is the ideal client-therapist relationship?\\nAPA says, “Psychotherapy is a collaborative treatment based on the relationship between an individual\\nand a psychologist. Grounded in dialogue, it provides a supportive environment that allows you to talk\\nopenly with someone who’s objective, neutral and nonjudgmental. You and your psychologist will work\\ntogether to identify and change the thought and behavior patterns that are keeping you from feeling\\nyour best.” It’s not just about solving the problem you saw the therapist for, but also about learning new\\nskills to help you cope better in the future when faced with the same or similar environmental stressors.\\nSo how do you find a psychotherapist? Several strategies may prove fruitful. You could ask family and\\nfriends, your primary care physician (PCP), look online, consult an area community mental health\\ncenter, your local university’s psychology department, state psychological association, or use APA’s\\nPsychologist Locator Service\\n(https://locator.apa.org/?_ga=2.160567293.1305482682.1516057794-1001575750.1501611950). Once\\nyou find a list of psychologists or other practitioners, choose the right one for you by determining if you\\nplan on attending alone or with family, what you wish to get out of your time with a psychotherapist,\\nhow much your insurance company pays for and if you have to pay out of pocket how much you can\\nafford, when you can attend sessions, and how far you are willing to travel to see the mental health\\nprofessional. Once you have done this, make your first appointment.\\nBut what should you bring? APA suggests, “to make the most of your time, make a list of the points you\\nwant to cover in your first session and what you want to work on in psychotherapy. Be prepared to\\nshare information about what’s bringing you to the psychologist. Even a vague idea of what you want to\\naccomplish can help you and your psychologist proceed efficiently and effectively.” Additionally, they\\nsuggest taking report cards, a list of medications, information on the reasons for a referral, a notebook,\\na calendar to schedule future visits if needed, and a form of payment. What you take depends on the\\nreason for the visit.\\nIn terms of what you should expect, you and your therapist will work to develop a full history which\\ncould take several visits. From this, a treatment plan will be developed. “This collaborative goal-setting\\nis important, because both of you need to be invested in achieving your goals. Your psychologist may\\nwrite down the goals and read them back to you, so you’re both clear about what you’ll be working on.\\nSome psychologists even create a treatment contract that lays out the purpose of treatment, its\\nexpected duration and goals, with both the individual’s and psychologist’s responsibilities outlined.”\\nAfter the initial visit, the mental health professional may conduct tests to further understand your\\ncondition but will continue talking through the issue. He/she may even suggest involving others,\\nespecially in cases of relationship issues. Resilience is a skill that will be taught so that you can better\\nhandle future situations.\\n            3.3.1.5. Does it work? APA writes, “Reviews of these studies show that about 75 percent of\\npeople who enter psychotherapy show some benefit. Other reviews have found that the average person\\nwho engages in psychotherapy is better off by the end of treatment than 80 percent of those who don’t'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n99\\nreceive treatment at all.” Treatment works due to finding evidence-based treatment that is specific for\\nthe person’s problem; the expertise of the therapist; and the characteristics, values, culture,\\npreferences, and personality of the client.\\n            3.3.1.6. How do you know you are finished? “How long psychotherapy takes depends on\\nseveral factors: the type of problem or disorder, the patient’s characteristics and history, the patient’s\\ngoals, what’s going on in the patient’s life outside psychotherapy and how fast the patient is able to\\nmake progress.” It is important to note that psychotherapy is not a lifelong commitment, and it is a joint\\ndecision of client and therapist as to when it ends. Once over, expect to have a periodic check-up with\\nyour therapist. This might be weeks or even months after your last session. If you need to see him/her\\nsooner, schedule an appointment. APA calls this a “mental health tune up” or a “booster session.”\\n \\nFor more on psychotherapy, please see the very interesting APA article on this matter:\\nhttp://www.apa.org/helpcenter/understanding-psychotherapy.aspx\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nAnyone can seek treatment and we all can benefit from it at some point in our lives.\\nPsychotherapy is when psychologists apply scientifically validated procedures to help a person\\nfeel better and develop healthy habits.\\n \\nSection 3.3 Review Questions\\nWhen should you seek help?1.\\nWhy should you seek professional help over the advice dispensed by family and friends?2.\\nHow do you find a therapist and what should you bring to your appointment?3.\\nDoes psychotherapy work?4.\\n \\nModule Recap\\nThat’s it.

Distinguishing Mood Disorders\\nWithin mood disorders are two distinct groups—individuals with depressive disorders and individuals\\nwith bipolar disorders. The key difference between the two mood disorder groups is episodes of\\nmania/hypomania. More specifically, in bipolar I disorder, the individual experiences a manic episode\\nthat “may have been preceded by and may be followed by hypomanic or major depressive episodes”\\n(APA, 2022, pg. 139) whereas for bipolar II disorder, the individual has experienced in the past or is\\ncurrently experiencing a hypomanic episode and has experienced in the past or is currently\\nexperiencing a major depressive episode. In contrast, individuals presenting with a depressive disorder\\nhave never experienced a manic or hypomanic episode.  \\n \\n4.1.2. Types of Depressive Disorders\\nThe two most common types of depressive disorders are major depressive disorder (MDD) and\\npersistent depressive disorder (PDD). Persistent depressive disorder, which in the DSM-5 now\\nincludes the diagnostic categories of dysthymia and chronic major depression, is a continuous and\\nchronic form of depression. While the symptoms of PDD are very similar to MDD, they are usually less\\nacute, as symptoms tend to ebb and flow over a long period (i.e., more than two years). Major\\ndepressive disorder, on the other hand, has discrete episodes lasting at least two weeks in which\\nthere are substantial changes in affect, cognition, and neurovegetative functions (APA, 2022, pg. 177).\\nIt should be noted that after a careful review of the literature, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, was\\nmoved from “Criteria Sets and Axes Provided for Future Study” in the DSM-IV to Section II of DSM-5 as\\nthe disorder was confirmed as a “specific and treatment-responsive form of depressive disorder that\\nbegins sometime following ovulation and remits within a few days of menses and has a marked impact\\non functioning” (APA, 2022, pg. 177).\\nThe DSM-5 also added a new diagnosis, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD), for\\nchildren up to 12 years of age, to deal with the potential for overdiagnosis and treatment of bipolar\\ndisorder in children, both in the United States and internationally. Children with DMDD present with\\npersistent irritability and frequent episodes of extreme behavioral dyscontrol and so develop unipolar,\\nnot bipolar, depressive disorders or anxiety disorders as they move into adolescence and adulthood.\\nFor a discussion of DMDD, please visit our sister book, Behavioral Disorders of Childhood:\\nhttps://opentext.wsu.edu/behavioral-disorders-childhood/\\n \\n4.1.3. Symptoms Associated with Depressive Disorders'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n104\\nWhen making a diagnosis of depression, there are a wide range of symptoms that may be present.\\nThese symptoms can generally be grouped into four categories: mood, behavioral, cognitive, and\\nphysical symptoms.\\n     4.1.3.1. Mood. While clinical depression can vary in its presentation among individuals, most, if not\\nall individuals with depression will report significant mood disturbances such as a depressed mood for\\nmost of the day and/or feelings of anhedonia, which is the loss of interest in previously interesting\\nactivities.\\n     4.1.3.2. Behavioral. Behavioral issues such as decreased physical activity and reduced\\nproductivity—both at home and work—are often observed in individuals with depression. This is\\ntypically where a disruption in daily functioning occurs as individuals with depressive disorders are\\nunable to maintain their social interactions and employment responsibilities.\\n     4.1.3.3. Cognitive. It should not come as a surprise that there is a serious disruption in cognitions\\nas individuals with depressive disorders typically hold a negative view of themselves and the world\\naround them. They are quick to blame themselves when things go wrong, and rarely take credit when\\nthey experience positive achievements. Individuals with depressive disorders often feel worthless,\\nwhich creates a negative feedback loop by reinforcing their overall depressed mood. They also report\\ndifficulty concentrating on tasks, as they are easily distracted from outside stimuli. This assertion is\\nsupported by research that has found individuals with depression perform worse than those without\\ndepression on tasks of memory, attention, and reasoning (Chen et al., 2013). Finally, thoughts of suicide\\nand self-harm do occasionally occur in those with depressive disorders (Note – this will be discussed in\\nmore detail in Section 4.3).\\n     4.1.3.4. Physical. Changes in sleep patterns are common in those experiencing depression with\\nreports of both hypersomnia and insomnia. Hypersomnia, or excessive sleeping, often impacts an\\nindividual’s daily functioning as they spend the majority of their time sleeping as opposed to\\nparticipating in daily activities (i.e., meeting up with friends or getting to work on time). Reports of\\ninsomnia are also frequent and can occur at various points throughout the night to include difficulty\\nfalling asleep, staying asleep, or waking too early with the inability to fall back asleep before having to\\nwake for the day. Although it is unclear whether symptoms of fatigue or loss of energy are related to\\ninsomnia issues, the fact that those experiencing hypersomnia also report symptoms of fatigue suggests\\nthat these symptoms are a component of the disorder rather than a secondary symptom of sleep\\ndisturbance.\\nAdditional physical symptoms, such as a change in weight or eating behaviors, are also observed.  Some\\nindividuals who are experiencing depression report a lack of appetite, often forcing themselves to eat\\nsomething during the day. On the contrary, others overeat, often seeking “comfort foods,” such as those\\nhigh in carbohydrates. Due to these changes in eating behaviors, there may be associated changes in\\nweight.\\nFinally, psychomotor agitation or retardation, which is the purposeless or slowed physical movement of\\nthe body (i.e., pacing around a room, tapping toes, restlessness, etc.) is also reported in individuals with\\ndepressive disorders.\\n \\n4.1.4. Diagnostic Criteria and Features for Depressive Disorders'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n105\\n     4.1.4.1. Major depressive disorder (MDD). According to the DSM-5-TR (APA, 2022), to meet the\\ncriteria for a diagnosis of major depressive disorder, an individual must experience at least five\\nsymptoms across the four categories discussed above, and at least one of the symptoms is either 1) a\\ndepressed mood most of the day, almost every day, or 2) loss of interest or pleasure in all, or most,\\nactivities, most of the day, almost every day. These symptoms must be present for at least two weeks\\nand cause clinically significant distress or impairment in important areas of functioning such as social\\nand occupational. The DSM-5 cautions that responses to a significant loss (such as the death of a loved\\none, financial ruin, and discovery of a serious medical illness or disability), can lead to many of the\\nsymptoms described above (i.e., intense sadness, rumination about the loss, insomnia, etc.) but this may\\nbe the normal response to such a loss. Though the individual’s response resembles a major depressive\\nepisode, clinical judgment should be utilized in making any diagnosis and be based on the clinician’s\\nunderstanding of the individual’s personal history and cultural norms related to how members should\\nexpress distress in the context of loss.\\n     4.1.4.2. Persistent depressive disorder (PDD). For a diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder,\\nan individual must experience a depressed mood for most of the day, for more days than not, for at least\\ntwo years. (APA, 2022). This feeling of a depressed mood is also accompanied by two or more additional\\nsymptoms, to include changes in appetite, insomnia or hypersomnia, low energy or fatigue, low self-\\nesteem, feelings of hopelessness, and poor concentration or difficulty with decision making. The\\nsymptoms taken together cause clinically significant distress or impairment in important areas of\\nfunctioning such as social and occupational and these impacts can be as great as or greater than MDD.\\nThe individual may experience a temporary relief of symptoms; however, the individual will not be\\nwithout symptoms for more than two months during this two-year period.\\n \\nMaking Sense of the Disorders\\nIn relation to depressive disorders, note the following:\\nDiagnosis MDD …… if symptoms have been experienced for at least two weeks  and can be\\nregarded as severe\\nDiagnosis PDD … if the symptoms have been experienced for at least two years    and are not\\nsevere\\n     4.1.4.3. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder. In terms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder, the\\nDSM-5-TR states in the majority of menstrual cycles, at least five symptoms must be present in the final\\nweek before the onset of menses, being improving with a few days after menses begins, and disappear\\nor become negligible in the week postmenses. Individuals diagnosed with premenstrual dysphoric\\ndisorder must have one or more of the following: increased mood swings, irritability or anger,\\ndepressed mood, or anxiety/tension. Additionally, they must have one or more of the following to reach\\na total of five symptoms: anhedonia, difficulty concentrating, lethargy, changes in appetite,\\nhypersomnia or insomnia, feelings of being overwhelmed or out of control, and/or experience breast\\ntenderness or swelling. The symptoms lead to issues at work or school (i.e., decreased productivity and\\nefficiency), within relationships (i.e., discord in the intimate partner relationship or with children,\\nfriends, or other family members), and with usual social activities (i.e., avoidance of the activities).'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n107\\ncan be preceded by and/or followed by a hypomanic or major depressive episode, however, diagnostic\\ncriteria for a manic episode is the only criteria that needs to be met for a bipolar I diagnosis. A\\ndiagnosis of bipolar II Disorder is made when there is a current or history of a hypomanic episode and a\\ncurrent or past major depressive episode. Descriptions of both manic and hypomanic episodes follow\\nbelow.\\nMaking Sense of the Disorders\\nIn relation to bipoloar I and II disorders, note the following:\\nDiagnosis bipolar I disorder …. if an individual has ever experienced a manic episode\\nDiagnosis bipolar II disorder … if the criteria has only been met for a hypomanic episode\\n \\n4.2.2. Manic and Hypomanic Episodes\\n     4.2.2.1. Manic episode. The key feature of a manic episode is a specific period in which an\\nindividual reports abnormal, persistent, or expansive irritable mood for nearly all day, every day, for at\\nleast one week (APA, 2022). Additionally, the individual will display increased activity or energy during\\nthis same time.  With regards to mood, an individual in a manic episode will appear excessively happy,\\noften engaging haphazardly in sexual or interpersonal interactions. They also display rapid shifts in\\nmood, also known as mood lability, ranging from happy, neutral, to irritable. At least three of the\\nsymptoms described below (four if the mood is only irritable) must be present and represent a\\nnoticeable change in the individual’s typical behavior.\\nInflated self-esteem or grandiosity (Criterion B1) is present during a manic episode. Occasionally these\\ninflated self-esteem levels can appear delusional. For example, individuals may believe they are friends\\nwith a celebrity, do not need to abide by laws, or even perceive themselves as God. They also engage in\\nmultiple overlapping new projects (Criteria B6 and 7), often initiated with no prior knowledge about the\\ntopic, and engaged in at unusual hours of the day.\\nDespite the increased activity level, individuals experiencing a manic episode also require a decreased\\nneed for sleep (Criterion B2), sleeping as little as a few hours a night yet still feeling rested. Reduced\\nneed for sleep may also be a precursor to a manic episode, suggesting that a manic episode is to begin\\nimminently. It is not uncommon for those experiencing a manic episode to be more talkative than usual.\\nIt can be difficult to follow their conversation due to the quick pace of their talking, as well as tangential\\nstorytelling.  Additionally, they can be difficult to interrupt in conversation, often disregarding the\\nreciprocal nature of communication (Criterion B3). If the individual is more irritable than expansive,\\nspeech can become hostile and they engage in tirades, particularly if they are interrupted or not\\nallowed to engage in an activity they are seeking out (APA, 2022).\\nBased on their speech pattern, it should not be a surprise that racing thoughts and flights of ideas\\n(Criterion B4) also present during manic episodes. Because of these rapid thoughts, speech may\\nbecome disorganized or incoherent. Finally, individuals experiencing a manic episode are distractable\\n(Criterion B5).\\n     4.2.2.2. Hypomanic episode. As mentioned above, for a bipolar II diagnosis, an individual must'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n108\\nreport symptoms consistent with a major depressive episode and at least one hypomanic episode. An\\nindividual with bipolar II disorder must not have a history of a manic episode—if there is a history of\\nmania, the diagnosis will be diagnosed with bipolar I. A hypomanic episode is like a manic episode in\\nthat the individual will experience abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood\\nand energy levels, however, the behaviors are not as extreme as in mania. Additionally, behaviors\\nconsistent with a hypomanic episode must be present for at least four days, compared to the one week\\nin a manic episode.\\n \\nMaking Sense of the Disorders\\nTake note of the following in relation to manic and hypomanic episodes:\\nA manic episode is severe enough to cause impairments in social or occupational functioning and\\ncan lead to hospitalization to prevent harm to self or others.\\nA hypomanic episode is NOT severe enough to cause such impairments or hospitalization.\\n4.2.3. Cyclothymic Disorder\\nNotably, there is a subclass of individuals who experience numerous periods with hypomanic symptoms\\nthat do not meet the criteria for a hypomanic episode and mild depressive symptoms (i.e., do not fully\\nmeet criteria for a major depressive episode). These individuals are diagnosed with cyclothymic\\ndisorder (APA, 2022). Presentation of these symptoms occur for two or more years and are typically\\ninterrupted by periods of normal mood not lasting more than two months at a time. The symptoms\\ncause clinically significant distress or impairment in important areas of functioning, such as social and\\noccupational. While only a small percentage of the population develops cyclothymic disorder, it can\\neventually progress into bipolar I or bipolar II disorder (Zeschel et al., 2015).\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nAn individual is diagnosed with bipolar I disorder if they have ever experienced a manic episode\\nand are diagnosed with bipolar II disorder if the criteria has only been met for a hypomanic\\nepisode.\\nA manic episode is characterized by a specific period in which an individual reports abnormal,\\npersistent, or expansive irritable mood for nearly all day, every day, for at least one week.\\nA hypomanic episode is characterized by abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or\\nirritable mood and energy levels, though not as extreme as in mania, and must be present for at\\nleast four days. It is also not severe enough to cause impairments or hospitalization.\\nCyclothymic disorder includes periods of hypomanic and mild depressive symptoms without\\nmeeting the criteria for a depressive episode which lasts two or more years and is interrupted by\\nperiods of normal moods.'),\n",

Depressive Disorders\\nAccording to the DSM-5-TR (APA, 2022), the 12-month prevalence rate for major depressive disorder is\\napproximately 7% within the United States. Recall that DSM-5 persistent depressive disorder is a blend\\nof DSM-IV dysthymic disorder and chronic major depressive disorder. The prevalence rate for DSM-IV\\ndysthymic disorder is much lower than MDD, with a 0.5% rate among adults in the United States, while\\nDSM-IV chronic major depressive disorder is 1.5%.\\nAs well, individuals in the 18- to 29- year-old age bracket report the highest rates of MDD than any\\nother age group. Women experience about twofold higher rates than men of MDD, especially between\\nmenarche and menopause (APA, 2022). The estimated lifetime prevalence for major depressive disorder\\nin women is 21.3% compared to 12.7% in men (Nolen-Hoeksema, 2001).

Women\\nattempt suicide at a higher rate though men are more likely to complete suicide. Finally, the\\npremenstrual phase is considered a risk period for suicide by some (APA, 2022).\\nIn terms of bipolar disorders, the lifetime risk of suicide is estimated to be 20- to 30- fold greater than in\\nthe general population and 5-6% of individuals with bipolar disorder die by suicide. Like depressive\\ndisorders, women attempt suicide at a higher rate though lethal suicide is more common in men with\\nbipolar disorder.

Comorbidity\\n \\nSection Learning Objectives\\nDescribe the comorbidity of depressive disorders.\\nDescribe the comorbidity of bipolar disorders.\\n \\n4.4.1. Depressive Disorders\\nStudies exploring depression symptoms among the general population show a substantial pattern of\\ncomorbidity between depression and other mental disorders, particularly substance use disorders\\n(Kessler, Berglund, et al., 2003). Nearly three-fourths of participants with lifetime MDD in a large-scale\\nresearch study also met the criteria for at least one other DSM disorder (Kessler, Berglund, et al.,\\n2003). MDD has been found to co-occur with substance-related disorders, panic disorder, generalized\\nanxiety disorder, PTSD, OCD, anorexia, bulimia, and borderline personality disorder. Gender\\ndifferences do exist within comorbidities such that women report comorbid anxiety disorders, bulimia,\\nand somatoform disorders while men report comorbid alcohol and substance abuse. In contrast, those\\nwith PDD are at higher risk for psychiatric comorbidity in general and for anxiety disorders, substance\\nuse disorders, and personality disorders in particular (APA, 2022).\\nGiven the extent of comorbidity among individuals with MDD, researchers have tried to identify which\\ndisorder precipitated the other. The majority of studies found that most depression cases occur\\nsecondary to another mental health disorder, meaning that the onset of depression is a direct result of\\nthe onset of another disorder (Gotlib & Hammen, 2009).\\n \\n4.4.2. Bipolar Disorders\\nThose with bipolar I disorder typically have a history of three or more mental disorders. The most\\nfrequent comorbid disorders include anxiety disorders, alcohol use disorder, other substance use\\ndisorder, and ADHD, along with borderline, schizotypal, and antisocial personality disorder.\\nBipolar II disorder is more often than not associated with one or more comorbid mental disorders, with\\nanxiety disorders being the most common (38% with social anxiety, 36% with specific phobia, and 30%\\nhaving generalized anxiety). As with bipolar I, substance use disorders are common with alcohol use\\n(42%) leading the way, followed by cannabis use (20%). Premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual\\ndysphoric disorder are common in women with bipolar II disorder especially (APA, 2022).\\nFinally, cyclothymic disorder has been found to be comorbid with substance-related disorders and sleep\\ndisorders.'),\n",

Etiology\\n \\nSection Learning Objectives\\nDescribe the biological causes of mood disorders.\\nDescribe the cognitive causes of mood disorders.\\nDescribe the behavioral causes of mood disorders.\\nDescribe the sociocultural causes of mood disorders.\\n \\n4.5.1. Biological\\nResearch throughout the years continues to provide evidence that depressive disorders have some\\nbiological cause. While it does not explain every depressive case, it is safe to say that some individuals\\nmay at least have a predisposition to developing a depressive disorder. Among the biological factors are\\ngenetic factors, biochemical factors, and brain structure.\\n     4.5.1.1. Genetics. Like with any disorder, researchers often explore the prevalence rate of\\ndepressive disorders among family members to determine if there is some genetic component, whether\\nit be a direct link or a predisposition. If there is a genetic predisposition to developing depressive\\ndisorders, one would expect a higher rate of depression within families than that of the general\\npopulation. Research supports this with regards to depressive disorders as there is nearly a 30%\\nincrease in relatives diagnosed with depression compared to 10% of the general population (Levinson &'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n113\\nNichols, 2014). Similarly, there is an elevated prevalence among first-degree relatives for both Bipolar I\\nand Bipolar II disorders as well.\\nAnother way to study the genetic component of a disorder is via twin studies. One would expect\\nidentical twins to have a higher rate of the disorder as opposed to fraternal twins, as identical twins\\nshare the same genetic make-up, whereas fraternal twins only share roughly 50%, similar to that of\\nsiblings. A large-scale study found that if one identical twin was diagnosed with depression, there was a\\n46% chance their identical twin was diagnosed with depression. In contrast, the rate of a depression\\ndiagnosis in fraternal twins was only 20%. Despite the fraternal twin rate still being higher than that of\\na first-degree relative, this study provided enough evidence that there is a strong genetic link in the\\ndevelopment of depression (McGuffin et al., 1996).\\nMore recently, scientists have been studying depression at a molecular level, exploring possibilities of\\ngene abnormalities as a cause for developing a depressive disorder. While much of the research is\\nspeculation due to sampling issues and low power, there is some evidence that depression may be tied\\nto the 5-HTT gene on chromosome 17, as this is responsible for the activity of serotonin (Jansen et al.,\\n2016).\\nBipolar disorders share a similar genetic predisposition to that of major depressive disorder. Twin\\nstudies within bipolar disorder yielded concordance rates for identical twins at as high as 72%, yet the\\nrange for fraternal twins, siblings, and other close relatives ranged from 5-15%. It is important to note\\nthat both percentages are significantly higher than that of the general population, suggesting a strong\\ngenetic component within bipolar disorder (Edvardsen et al., 2008). The DSM-5-TR more recently\\nreports heritability estimates around 90% in some twin studies and the risk of bipolar disorder being\\naround 1% in the general population compared to 5-10% in a first-degree relative (APA, 2022).\\n     4.5.1.2. Biochemical. As you will read in the treatment section, there is strong evidence of a\\nbiochemical deficit in depression and bipolar disorders. More specifically, low activity levels of\\nnorepinephrine and serotonin, have long been documented as contributing factors to developing\\ndepressive disorders. This relationship was discovered accidentally in the 1950s when MAOIs were\\ngiven to tuberculosis patients, and miraculously, their depressive moods were also improved. Soon\\nthereafter, medical providers found that medications used to treat high blood pressure by causing a\\nreduction in norepinephrine also caused depression in their patients (Ayd, 1956).\\nWhile these initial findings were premature in the identification of how neurotransmitters affected the\\ndevelopment of depressive features, they did provide insight as to what neurotransmitters were\\ninvolved in this system. Researchers are still trying to determine exact pathways; however, it does\\nappear that both norepinephrine and serotonin are involved in the development of symptoms, whether it\\nbe between the interaction between them, or their interaction on other neurotransmitters (Ding et al.,\\n2014).\\nDue to the close nature of depression and bipolar disorder, researchers initially believed that both\\nnorepinephrine and serotonin were implicated in the development of bipolar disorder; however, the idea\\nwas that there was a drastic increase in serotonin during mania episodes. Unfortunately, research\\nsupports the opposite. It is believed that low levels of serotonin and high levels of norepinephrine may\\nexplain mania episodes (Soreff & McInnes, 2014). Despite these findings, additional research within\\nthis area is needed to conclusively determine what is responsible for the manic episodes within bipolar\\ndisorder.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n114\\n     4.5.1.3. Endocrine system. As you may know, the endocrine system is a collection of glands\\nresponsible for regulating hormones, metabolism, growth and development, sleep, and mood, among\\nother things. Some research has implicated hormones, particularly cortisol, a hormone released as a\\nstress response, in the development of depression (Owens et al., 2014). Additionally, melatonin, a\\nhormone released when it is dark outside to assist with the transition to sleep, may also be related to\\ndepressive symptoms, particularly during the winter months.\\n     4.5.1.4. Brain anatomy. Seeing as neurotransmitters have been implicated in the development of\\ndepressive disorders, it should not be a surprise that various brain structures have also been identified\\nas contributors to mood disorders. While exact anatomy and pathways are yet to be determined,\\nresearch studies implicate the prefrontal cortex, the hippocampus, and the amygdala. More\\nspecifically, drastic changes in blood flow throughout the prefrontal cortex have been linked with\\ndepressive symptoms. Similarly, a smaller hippocampus, and consequently, fewer neurons, has also\\nbeen linked to depressive symptoms. Finally, heightened activity and blood flow in the amygdala, the\\nbrain area responsible for our fight or flight response, is also consistently found in individuals with\\ndepressive symptoms.\\nAbnormalities in several brain structures have also been identified in individuals with bipolar disorder;\\nhowever, what or why these structures are abnormal has yet to be determined. Researchers continue to\\nfocus on areas of the basal ganglia and cerebellum, which appear to be much smaller in individuals with\\nbipolar disorder compared to the general public. Additionally, there appears to be a decrease in brain\\nactivity in regions associated with regulating emotions, as well as an increase in brain activity among\\nstructures related to emotional responsiveness (Houenou et al., 2011). Additional research is still\\nneeded to determine precisely how each of these brain structures may be implicated in the development\\nof bipolar disorder.\\n \\n4.5.2. Cognitive\\nThe cognitive model, arguably the most conclusive model with regards to depressive disorders, focuses\\non the negative thoughts and perceptions of an individual. One theory often equated with the cognitive\\nmodel of depression is learned helplessness. Coined by Martin Seligman (1975), learned helplessness\\nwas developed based on his laboratory experiment involving dogs. In this study, Seligman restrained\\ndogs in an apparatus and routinely shocked them regardless of their behavior. The following day, the\\ndogs were placed in a similar apparatus; however, this time they were not restrained and there was a\\nsmall barrier placed between the “shock” floor and the “safe” floor. What Seligman observed was that\\ndespite the opportunity to escape the shock, the dogs flurried for a bit, and then ultimately laid down\\nand whimpered while being shocked.\\nBased on this study, Seligman concluded that the animals essentially learned that they were unable to\\navoid the shock the day prior, and therefore, learned that they were helpless in preventing the shocks.\\nWhen they were placed in a similar environment but had the opportunity to escape the shock, their\\nlearned helplessness carried over, and they continued to believe they were unable to escape the shock.\\nThis study has been linked to humans through research on attributional style (Nolen-Hoeksema,\\nGirgus & Seligman, 1992). There are two types of attributional styles—positive and negative. A negative\\nattributional style focuses on the internal, stable, and global influence of daily lives, whereas a positive\\nattributional style focuses on the external, unstable, and specific influence of the environment.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n115\\nResearch has found that individuals with a negative attributional style are more likely to experience\\ndepression. This is likely due to their negative interpretation of daily events. For example, if something\\nbad were to happen to them, they would conclude that it is their fault (internal), bad things always\\nhappen to them (stable), and bad things happen all day to them. Unfortunately, this maladaptive\\nthinking style often takes over an individual’s daily view, thus making them more vulnerable to\\ndepression.\\nIn addition to attributional style, Aaron Beck also attributed negative thinking as a precursor to\\ndepressive disorders (Beck, 2002, 1991, 1967). Often viewed as the grandfather of Cognitive-Behavioral\\nTherapy, Beck went on to coin the terms—maladaptive attitudes, cognitive triad, errors in thinking, and\\nautomatic thoughts—all of which combine to explain the cognitive model of depressive disorders.\\nMaladaptive attitudes, or negative attitudes about oneself, others, and the world around them are\\noften present in those with depressive symptoms. These attitudes are inaccurate and often global. For\\nexample, “If I fail my exam, the world will know I’m stupid.” Will the entire world really know you failed\\nyour exam? Not likely. Because you fail the exam, are you stupid? No. Individuals with depressive\\nsymptoms often develop these maladaptive attitudes regarding everything in their life, indirectly\\nisolating themselves from others. The cognitive triad also plays into the maladaptive attitudes in that\\nthe individual interprets these negative thoughts about their experiences, themselves, and their futures.\\nCognitive distortions, also known as errors in thinking, are a key component in Beck’s cognitive\\ntheory. Beck identified 15 errors in thinking that are most common in individuals with depression (see\\nthe end of the module). Among the most common are catastrophizing, jumping to conclusions, and\\novergeneralization. I always like to use my dad (first author’s dad) as an example for overgeneralization.\\nWhenever we go to the grocery store, he always comments about how whatever line he chooses, at\\nevery store, it is always the slowest line. Does this happen every time he is at the store? I’m doubtful,\\nbut his error in thinking leads to him believing this is true.\\nFinally, automatic thoughts, or the constant stream of negative thoughts, also leads to symptoms of\\ndepression as individuals begin to feel as though they are inadequate or helpless in a given situation.\\nWhile some cognitions are manipulated and interpreted negatively, Beck stated that there is another set\\nof negative thoughts that occur automatically. Research studies have continually supported Beck’s\\nmaladaptive thoughts, attitudes, and errors in thinking as fundamental issues in those with depressive\\ndisorders (Lai et al., 2014; Possel & Black, 2014). Furthermore, as you will see in the treatment section\\n(Section 4.5), cognitive strategies are among the most effective forms of treatment for depressive\\ndisorders.\\n \\n4.5.3. Behavioral\\nThe behavioral model explains depression as a result of a change in the number of rewards and\\npunishments one receives throughout their life. This change can come from work, intimate\\nrelationships, family, or even the environment in general. Among the most influential in the field of\\ndepression is Peter Lewinsohn. He stated depression occurred in most people due to reduced positive\\nrewards in their life. Because they were not positively rewarded, their constructive behaviors occurred\\nmore infrequently until they stop engaging in the behavior completely (Lewinsohn et al., 1990; 1984).\\nAn example of this is a student who keeps receiving bad grades on their exam despite studying for\\nhours. Over time, the individual will reduce the amount of time they are studying, thus continuing to'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n116\\nearn poor grades.\\n \\n4.5.4. Sociocultural\\nIn the sociocultural theory, the role of family and one’s social environment play a substantial role in the\\ndevelopment of depressive disorders. There are two sociocultural views: the family-social perspective\\nand the multi-cultural perspective.\\n     4.5.4.1. Family-social perspective. Similar to that of the behavioral theory, the family-social\\nperspective of depression suggests that depression is related to the unavailability of social support. This\\nis often supported by research studies that show separated and divorced individuals are three times\\nmore likely to experience depressive symptoms than those that are married or even widowed (Schultz,\\n2007). While many factors lead a couple to separate or end their marriage, some relationships end due\\nto a spouse’s mental health issues, particularly depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms have been\\npositively related to increased interpersonal conflicts, reduced communication, and intimacy issues, all\\nof which are often reported in causal factors leading to a divorce (Najman et al., 2014).\\nThe family-social perspective can also be viewed oppositely, with stress and marital discord leading to\\nincreased rates of depression in one or both spouses (Nezlek et al., 2000). While some research\\nindicates that having children provides a positive influence in one’s life, it can also lead to stress both\\nwithin the individual, as well as between partners due to division of work and discipline differences.\\nStudies have shown that women who had three or more young children, and also lacked a close\\nconfidante and outside employment, were more likely than other mothers to become depressed (Brown,\\n2002).\\n     4.5.4.2. Multi-cultural perspective. While depression is experienced across the entire world,\\none’s cultural background may influence what symptoms of depression are presented. Common\\ndepressive symptoms such as feeling sad, lack of energy, anhedonia, difficulty concentrating, and\\nthoughts of suicide are a hallmark in most societies; other symptoms may be more specific to one’s\\nnationality. More specifically, individuals from non-Western countries (China and other Asian countries)\\noften focus on the physical symptoms of depression—tiredness, weakness, sleep issues—and less of an\\nemphasis on the cognitive symptoms.\\nWithin the United States, many researchers have explored potential differences across ethnic or racial\\ngroups in both rates of depression, as well as presenting symptoms of those diagnosed with depression.\\nThese studies continually fail to identify any significant differences between ethnic and racial groups;\\nhowever, one major study has identified a difference in the rate of recurrence of depression in Hispanic\\nand African Americans (Gonzalez et al., 2010). While the exact reason for this is unclear, researchers\\npropose a lack of treatment opportunities as a possible explanation. According to Gonzalez and\\ncolleagues (2010), approximately 54% of depressed white Americans seek out treatment, compared to\\nthe 34% and 40% Hispanic and African Americans, respectively. The fact that there is a large\\ndiscrepancy in the use of treatment between white Americans and minority Americans suggests that\\nthese individuals are not receiving the effective treatment necessary to resolve the disorder, thus\\nleaving them more vulnerable for repeated depressive episodes.\\n            4.5.4.3. Gender differences. As previously discussed, there is a significant difference between\\ngender and rates of depression, with women twice as likely to experience an episode of depression than'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n117\\nmen (Schuch et al., 2014). There are a few speculations as to why there is such an imbalance in the rate\\nof depression across genders.\\nThe first theory, artifact theory, suggests that the difference between genders is due to clinician or\\ndiagnostic systems being more sensitive to diagnosing women with depression than men. While women\\nare often thought to be more “emotional,” easily expressing their feelings and more willing to discuss\\ntheir symptoms with clinicians and physicians, men often withhold their symptoms or will present with\\nmore traditionally “masculine” symptoms of anger or aggression. While this theory is a possible\\nexplanation for the gender differences in the rate of depression, research has failed to support this\\ntheory, suggesting that men and women are equally likely to seek out treatment and discuss their\\ndepressive symptoms (McSweeney, 2004; Rieker & Bird, 2005).\\nThe second theory, hormone theory, suggests that variations in hormone levels trigger depression in\\nwomen more than men (Graziottin & Serafini, 2009). While there is biological evidence supporting the\\nchanges in hormone levels during various phases of the menstrual cycle and their impact on women’s\\nability to integrate and process emotional information, research fails to support this theory as the\\nreason for higher rates of depression in women (Whiffen & Demidenko, 2006).\\nThe third theory, life stress theory, suggests that women are more likely to experience chronic stressors\\nthan men, thus accounting for their higher rate of depression (Astbury, 2010). Women face increased\\nrisk for poverty, lower employment opportunities, discrimination, and poorer quality of housing than\\nmen, all of which are strong predictors of depressive symptoms (Garcia-Toro et al., 2013).\\nThe fourth theory, gender roles theory, suggests that social and or psychological factors related to\\ntraditional gender roles also influence the rate of depression in women. For example, men are often\\nencouraged to develop personal autonomy, seek out activities that interest them, and display\\nachievement-oriented goals; women are encouraged to empathize and care for others, often fostering\\nan interdependent functioning, which may cause women to value the opinion of others more highly than\\ntheir male counterparts do.\\nThe final theory, rumination theory, suggests that women are more likely than men to ruminate, or\\nintently focus, on their depressive symptoms, thus making them more vulnerable to developing\\ndepression at a clinical level (Nolen-Hoeksema, 2012). Several studies have supported this theory and\\nshown that rumination of negative thoughts is positively related to an increase in depression symptoms\\n(Hankin, 2009).\\nWhile many theories try to explain the gender discrepancy in depressive episodes, no single theory has\\nproduced enough evidence to fully explain why women experience depression more than men.

Depressive Disorders\\nGiven that Major Depressive Disorder is among the most frequent and debilitating psychiatric\\ndisorders, it should not be surprising that the research on this disorder is quite extensive. Among its\\ntreatment options, the most efficacious ones include antidepressant medications, Cognitive-Behavioral\\nTherapy (CBT; Beck et al., 1979), Behavioral Activation (BA; Jacobson et al., 2001), and Interpersonal\\nTherapy (IPT; Klerman et al., 1984). Although CBT is the most widely known and used treatment for\\nMajor Depressive Disorder, there is minimal evidence to support one treatment modality over the other;\\ntreatment is generally dictated by therapist competence, availability, and patient preference\\n(Craighhead & Dunlop, 2014).\\n     4.6.1.1. Psychopharmacology – Antidepressant medications. Antidepressants are often the\\nmost common first-line attempt at treatment for MDD for a few reasons. Oftentimes an individual will\\npresent with symptoms to their primary caregiver (a medical doctor) who will prescribe them some line\\nof antidepressant medication. Medication is often seen as an “easier” treatment for depression as the\\nindividual can take the medication at their home, rather than attending weekly therapy sessions;\\nhowever, this also leaves room for adherence issues as a large percentage of individuals fail to take\\nprescription medication as indicated by their physician. Given the biological functions of\\nneurotransmitters and their involvement in maintaining depressive symptoms, it makes sense that this\\nis an effective type of treatment.\\nWithin antidepressant medications, there are a few different classes, each categorized by their\\nstructural or functional relationships. It should be noted that no specific antidepressant medication\\nclass or medication have been proven to be more effective in treating MDD than others (APA, 2010). In\\nfact, many patients may try several different types of antidepressant medications until they find one\\nthat is effective, with minimal side effects.\\n     4.6.1.2. Psychopharmacology – Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). SSRIs are\\namong the most common medications used to treat depression due to their relatively benign side\\neffects. Additionally, the required dose to reach therapeutic levels is low compared to the other\\nmedication options.  Possible side effects from SSRIs include but are not limited to nausea, insomnia,\\nand reduced sex drive.\\nSSRIs improve depression symptoms by blocking the reuptake of norepinephrine and/or serotonin in\\npresynaptic neurons, thus allowing more of these neurotransmitters to be available for postsynaptic\\nneurons. While this is the general mechanism through which all SSRI’s work, there are minor biological\\ndifferences among different types of medications within the SSRI family. These small differences are\\nbeneficial to patients in that there are a few treatment options to maximize medication benefits and\\nminimize side effects.\\n     4.6.1.3. Psychopharmacology – Tricyclic antidepressants. Although originally developed to\\ntreat schizophrenia, tricyclic antidepressants were adapted to treat depression after failing to manage\\nsymptoms of schizophrenia (Kuhn, 1958). The term tricyclic came from the molecular shape of the\\nstructure: three rings.\\nTricyclic antidepressants are like SSRIs in that they work by affecting brain chemistry, altering the\\nnumber of neurotransmitters available for neurons. More specifically, they block the absorption or'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n120\\nreuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, thus increasing their availability for postsynaptic neurons.\\nWhile effective, tricyclic antidepressants have been increasingly replaced by SSRIs due to their reduced\\nside effects. However, tricyclic antidepressants have been shown to be more effective in treating\\ndepressive symptoms in individuals who have not been able to achieve symptom reduction via other\\npharmacological approaches.\\nWhile the majority of the side effects are minimal – dry mouth, blurry vision, constipation, others can be\\nserious such as sexual dysfunction, tachycardia, cognitive and/or memory impairment. Due to the\\npotential impact on the heart, tricyclic antidepressants should not be used in cardiac patients as they\\nmay exacerbate cardiac arrhythmias (Roose & Spatz, 1999).\\n     4.6.1.4. Psychopharmacology – Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).  The use of MAOIs as\\na treatment for depression began serendipitously as patients in the early 1950s reported reduced\\ndepression symptoms while on the medication to treat tuberculosis. Research studies confirmed that\\nMAOIs were effective in treating depression in adults outside the treatment of tuberculosis. Although\\nstill prescribed, they are not typically first-line medications due to their safety concerns with\\nhypertensive crises. Because of this, individuals on MAOIs have strict diet restrictions to reduce their\\nrisk of hypertensive crises (Shulman, Herrman & Walker, 2013).\\nHow do MAOIs work? In basic terms, monoamine oxidase is released in the brain to remove excess\\nneurotransmitters norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine. MAOIs essentially prevent the monoamine\\noxidase (hence the name monoamine oxidase inhibitors) from removing these neurotransmitters, thus\\nresulting in an increase in these brain chemicals (Shulman, Herman & Walker, 2013). As previously\\ndiscussed, norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine are all involved in the biological mechanisms of\\nmaintaining depressive symptoms.\\nWhile these drugs are effective, they come with serious side effects. In addition to the hypertensive\\nepisodes, they can also cause nausea, headaches, drowsiness, involuntary muscle jerks, reduced sexual\\ndesire, weight gain, etc. (APA, 2010). Despite these side effects, studies have shown that individuals\\nprescribed MAOIs for depression have a treatment response rate of 50-70% (Krishnan, 2007). Overall,\\ndespite their effectiveness, MAOIs are likely the best treatment for late-stage, treatment-resistant\\ndepression patients who have exhausted other treatment options (Krishnan, 2007).\\nIt should be noted that occasionally, antipsychotic medications are used for individuals with MDD;\\nhowever, these are limited to individuals presenting with psychotic features.\\n     4.6.1.5. Psychotherapy – Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT was founded by Aaron Beck\\nin the 1960s and is a widely practiced therapeutic tool used to treat depression (and other disorders as\\nwell). The basics of CBT involve what Beck called the cognitive triangle— cognitions (thoughts),\\nbehaviors, and emotions. Beck believed that these three components are interconnected, and therefore,\\naffect one another. It is believed that CBT can improve emotions in depressed patients by changing both\\ncognitions (thoughts) and behaviors, which in return enhances mood. Common cognitive interventions\\nwith CBT include thought monitoring and recording, identifying cognitive errors, examining evidence\\nsupporting/negating cognitions, and creating rational alternatives to maladaptive thought patterns.\\nBehavioral interventions of CBT include activity planning, pleasant event scheduling, task assignments,\\nand coping-skills training.\\nCBT generally follows four phases of treatment:'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n121\\nPhase 1: Increasing pleasurable activities. Similar to behavioral activation (see below), the\\nclinician encourages the patient to identify and engage in activities that are pleasurable to the\\nindividual. The clinician can help the patient to select the activity, as well as help them plan when\\nthey will engage in that activity.\\nPhase 2: Challenging automatic thoughts. During this stage, the clinician provides\\npsychoeducation about the negative automatic thoughts that can maintain depressive symptoms.\\nThe patient will learn to identify these thoughts on their own during the week and maintain a\\nthought journal of these cognitions to review with the clinician in session.\\nPhase 3: Identifying negative thoughts. Once the individual is consistently able to identify\\nthese negative thoughts on a daily basis, the clinician can help the patient identify how these\\nthoughts are maintaining their depressive symptoms. It is at this point that the patient begins to\\nhave direct insight as to how their cognitions contribute to their disorder.\\nPhase 4: Changing thoughts. The final stage of treatment involves challenging the negative\\nthoughts the patient has been identifying in the last two phases of treatment and replacing them\\nwith positive thoughts.\\n     4.6.1.6. Psychotherapy – Behavioral activation (BA). BA is similar to the behavioral component\\nof CBT in that the goal of treatment is to alleviate depression and prevent future relapse by changing an\\nindividual’s behavior. Founded by Ferster (1973), as well as Lewinsohn and colleagues (Lewinsohn,\\n1974; Lewinsohn, Biglan, & Zeiss, 1976), the goal of BA is to increase the frequency of behaviors so that\\nindividuals have opportunities to experience greater contact with sources of reward in their lives. To do\\nthis, the clinician assists the patient by developing a list of pleasurable activities that they can engage in\\noutside of treatment (i.e., going for a walk, going shopping, having dinner with a friend). Additionally,\\nthe clinician assists the patient in identifying their negative behaviors—crying, sleeping in, avoiding\\nfriends—and monitoring them so that they do not impact the outcome of their pleasurable activities.\\nFinally, the clinician works with the patient on effective social skills. By minimizing negative behaviors\\nand maximizing pleasurable activities, the individual will receive more positive reward and\\nreinforcement from others and their environment, thus improving their overall mood.\\n     4.6.1.7. Psychotherapy – Interpersonal therapy (IPT). IPT was developed by Klerman,\\nWeissman, and colleagues in the 1970s as a treatment arm for a pharmacotherapy study of depression\\n(Weissman, 1995). The treatment was created based on data from post-World War II individuals who\\nexpressed a substantial impact on their psychosocial life events. Klerman and colleagues noticed a\\nsignificant relationship between the development of depression and complicated bereavement, role\\ndisputes, role transitions, and interpersonal deficits in these individuals (Weissman, 1995). The idea\\nbehind IPT is that depressive episodes compromise interpersonal functioning, which makes it difficult to\\nmanage stressful life events. The basic mechanism of IPT is to establish effective strategies to manage\\ninterpersonal issues, which in return, will ameliorate depressive symptoms.\\nThere are two main principles of IPT. First, depression is a common medical illness with a complex and\\nmulti-determined etiology. Since depression is a medical illness, it is also treatable and not the patient’s\\nfault. Second, depression is connected to a current or recent life event. The goal of IPT is to identify the\\ninterpersonal problem that is related to the depressive symptoms and solve this crisis so the patient can\\nimprove their life situation while relieving depressive symptoms.\\n     4.6.1.8. Multimodal treatment. While both pharmacological and psychological treatment alone is\\nvery effective in treating depression, a combination of the two treatments may offer additional benefits,\\nparticularly in the maintenance of wellness. Additionally, multimodal treatment options may be helpful'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n122\\nfor individuals who have not achieved wellness in a single modality.\\nMultimodal treatments can be offered in three different ways: concurrently, sequentially, or within a\\nstepped manner (McGorry et al., 2010). With a stepped manner treatment, pharmacological therapy is\\noften used initially to treat depressive symptoms. Once the patient reports some relief in symptoms, the\\npsychosocial treatment is added to address the remaining symptoms. While all three methods are\\neffective in managing depressive symptoms, matching patients to their treatment preferences may\\nproduce better outcomes than clinician-driven treatment decisions.\\n \\n4.6.2. Bipolar Disorder\\n     4.6.2.1. Psychopharmacology. Unlike treatment for MDD, there is some controversy regarding\\neffective treatment of bipolar disorder. One suggestion is to treat bipolar disorder  aggressively with\\nmood stabilizers such as Lithium or Depakote as these medications do not induce pharmacological\\nmania/hypomania. These mood stabilizers are occasionally combined with antidepressants later in\\ntreatment only if absolutely necessary (Ghaemi, Hsu, Soldani & Goodwin, 2003). Research has shown\\nthat mood stabilizers are less potent in treating depressive symptoms, and therefore, the combination\\napproach is believed to help manage both the manic and depressive episodes (Nivoli et al., 2011).\\nThe other treatment option is to forgo the mood stabilizer and treat symptoms with newer\\nantidepressants early in treatment. Unfortunately, large scale research studies have not shown great\\nsupport for this method (Gijsman, Geddes, Rendell, Nolen, & Goodwin, 2004; Moller, Grunze & Broich,\\n2006). Antidepressants often trigger a manic or hypomanic episode in bipolar patients. Because of this,\\nthe first-line treatment option for bipolar disorder  is mood stabilizers, particularly Lithium.\\n     4.6.2.2. Psychological treatment. Although psychopharmacology is the first and most widely used\\ntreatment for bipolar disorders, occasionally psychological interventions are also paired with\\nmedication as psychotherapy alone is not a sufficient treatment option. Majority of psychological\\ninterventions are aimed at medication adherence, as many bipolar patients stop taking their mood\\nstabilizers when they “feel better” (Advokat et al., 2014). Social skills training and problem-solving\\nskills are also helpful techniques to address in the therapeutic setting as individuals with bipolar\\ndisorder often struggle in this area.\\n \\n4.6.3. Outcome of Treatment\\n     4.6.3.1. Depressive treatment. As we have discussed, major depressive disorder has a variety of\\ntreatment options, all found to be efficacious. However, research suggests that while\\npsychopharmacological interventions are more effective in rapidly reducing symptoms, psychotherapy,\\nor even a combined treatment approach, are more effective in establishing long-term relief of\\nsymptoms.\\nRates of relapse for major depressive disorder are often associated with individuals whose onset was at\\na younger age (particularly adolescents), those who have already experienced multiple major depressive\\nepisodes, and those with more severe symptomology, especially those presenting with severe suicidal\\nideation and psychotic features (APA, 2022).'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n123\\n     4.6.3.2. Bipolar treatment. Lithium and other mood stabilizers are very effective in managing\\nsymptoms of patients with bipolar disorder. Unfortunately, it is the adherence to the medication\\nregimen that is often the issue with these patients. Bipolar patients often desire the euphoric highs that\\nare associated with manic and hypomanic episodes, leading them to forgo their medication. A\\ncombination of psychopharmacology and psychotherapy aimed at increasing the rate of adherence to\\nmedical treatment may be the most effective treatment option for bipolar I and II disorder.\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nTreatment of depressive disorders include psychopharmacological options such as anti-depressant\\nmediations, SSRIs, tricyclic antidepressants, and MAOIs and/or psychotherapy options to include\\nCBT, behavioral activation (BA), and interpersonal therapy (IPT).

A stress disorder occurs when an\\nindividual has difficulty coping with or adjusting to a recent stressor. Stressors can be any\\nevent—either witnessed firsthand, experienced personally, or experienced by a close family\\nmember—that increases physical or psychological demands on an individual. These events are\\nsignificant enough that they pose a threat, whether real or imagined, to the individual. While many\\npeople experience similar stressors throughout their lives, only a small percentage of individuals\\nexperience significant maladjustment to the event that psychological intervention is warranted.\\nAmong the most studied triggers for trauma-related disorders are combat and physical/sexual assault.\\nSymptoms of combat-related trauma date back to World War I when soldiers would return home with\\n“shell shock” (Figley, 1978). Unfortunately, it was not until after the Vietnam War that significant\\nprogress was made in both identifying and treating war-related psychological difficulties (Roy-Byrne et\\nal., 2004). With the more recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, attention was again focused on\\nposttraumatic stress disorder  (PTSD) symptoms due to the large number of service members returning\\nfrom deployments and reporting significant trauma symptoms.\\nPhysical assault, and more specifically sexual assault, is another commonly studied traumatic event.\\nRape, or forced sexual intercourse or other sexual act committed without an individual’s consent,\\noccurs in one out of every five women and one in every 71 men (Black et al., 2011). Unfortunately, this\\nstatistic likely underestimates the actual number of cases that occur due to the reluctance of many\\nindividuals to report their sexual assault. Of the reported cases, it is estimated that nearly 81% of\\nfemale and 35% of male rape victims report both acute stress disorder and posttraumatic stress\\ndisorder symptoms (Black et al., 2011).\\nNow that we have discussed a little about some of the most commonly studied traumatic events, we will\\nnow examine the clinical presentation of posttraumatic stress disorder, acute stress disorder,\\nadjustment disorder, and prolonged grief disorder.\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nA stressor is any event that increases physical or psychological demands on an individual.\\nIt does not have to be personally experienced but can be witnessed or occur to a close family\\nmember or friend to have the same effect.\\nOnly a small percentage of people experience significant maladjustment due to these events.\\nThe most studied triggers for trauma-related disorders include physical/sexual assault and\\ncombat.'),\n",

Clinical Presentation\\n \\nSection Learning Objectives\\nDescribe how PTSD presents.\\nDescribe how acute stress disorder presents.\\nDescribe how adjustment disorder presents.\\nDescribe how prolonged grief disorder presents.\\n \\n5.2.1. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder\\nPosttraumatic stress disorder, or more commonly known as PTSD, is identified by the development of\\nphysiological, psychological, and emotional symptoms following exposure to a traumatic event.\\nIndividuals must have been exposed to a situation where actual or threatened death, sexual violence, or\\nserious injury occurred. Examples of these situations include but are not limited to witnessing a\\ntraumatic event as it occurred to someone else; learning about a traumatic event that occurred to a\\nfamily member or close friend; directly experiencing a traumatic event; or being exposed to repeated\\nevents where one experiences an aversive event (e.g., victims of child abuse/neglect, ER physicians in\\ntrauma centers, etc.).\\nIt is important to understand that while the presentation of these symptoms varies among individuals, to\\nmeet the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD, individuals need to report symptoms among the four different\\ncategories of symptoms.\\n     5.2.1.1. Category 1: Recurrent experiences. The first category involves recurrent experiences of\\nthe traumatic event, which can occur via dissociative reactions such as flashbacks; recurrent,\\ninvoluntary, and intrusive distressing memories; or even recurrent distressing dreams (APA, 2022, pgs.\\n301-2). These recurrent experiences must be specific to the traumatic event or the moments\\nimmediately following to meet the criteria for PTSD. Regardless of the method, the recurrent\\nexperiences can last several seconds or extend for several days. They are often initiated by physical\\nsensations similar to those experienced during the traumatic events or environmental triggers such as a\\nspecific location. Because of these triggers, individuals with PTSD are known to avoid stimuli (i.e.,'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n128\\nactivities, objects, people, etc.) associated with the traumatic event. One or more of the intrusion\\nsymptoms must be present.\\n     5.2.1.2. Category 2: Avoidance of stimuli. The second category involves avoidance of stimuli\\nrelated to the traumatic event and either one or both of the following must be present. First, individuals\\nwith PTSD may be observed trying to avoid the distressing thoughts, memories, and/or feelings related\\nto the memories of the traumatic event. Second, they may prevent these memories from occurring by\\navoiding physical stimuli such as locations, individuals, activities, or even specific situations that trigger\\nthe memory of the traumatic event.\\n     5.2.1.3. Category 3: Negative alterations in cognition or mood. The third category experienced\\nby individuals with PTSD is negative alterations in cognition or mood and at least two of the symptoms\\ndescribed below must be present. This is often reported as difficulty remembering an important aspect\\nof the traumatic event. It should be noted that this amnesia is not due to a head injury, loss of\\nconsciousness, or substances, but rather, due to the traumatic nature of the event. The impaired\\nmemory may also lead individuals to have false beliefs about the causes of the traumatic event, often\\nblaming themselves or others. An overall persistent negative state, including a generalized negative\\nbelief about oneself or others is also reported by those with PTSD. Similar to those with depression,\\nindividuals with PTSD may report a reduced interest in participating in previously enjoyable activities,\\nas well as the desire to engage with others socially. They also report not being able to experience\\npositive emotions.\\n     5.2.1.4. Category 4: Alterations in arousal and reactivity. The fourth and final category\\nis alterations in arousal and reactivity and at least two of the symptoms described below must be\\npresent. Because of the negative mood and increased irritability, individuals with PTSD may be quick-\\ntempered and act out aggressively, both verbally and physically. While these aggressive responses may\\nbe provoked, they are also sometimes unprovoked. It is believed these behaviors occur due to the\\nheightened sensitivity to potential threats, especially if the threat is similar to their traumatic event.\\nMore specifically, individuals with PTSD have a heightened startle response and easily jump or respond\\nto unexpected noises just as a telephone ringing or a car backfiring. They also experience significant\\nsleep disturbances, with difficulty falling asleep, as well as staying asleep due to nightmares; engage in\\nreckless or self-destructive behavior, and have problems concentrating.\\nAlthough somewhat obvious, these symptoms likely cause significant distress in social, occupational,\\nand other (i.e., romantic, personal) areas of functioning. Duration of symptoms is also important, as\\nPTSD cannot be diagnosed unless symptoms have been present for at least one month. If symptoms\\nhave not been present for a month, the individual may meet criteria for acute stress disorder (see\\nbelow).\\n \\n5.2.2. Acute Stress Disorder\\nAcute stress disorder is very similar to PTSD except for the fact that symptoms must be present from 3\\ndays to 1 month following exposure to one or more traumatic events. If the symptoms are present\\nafter one month, the individual would then meet the criteria for PTSD. Additionally, if symptoms present\\nimmediately following the traumatic event but resolve by day 3, an individual would not meet the\\ncriteria for acute stress disorder.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n129\\nSymptoms of acute stress disorder follow that of PTSD with a few exceptions. PTSD requires symptoms\\nwithin each of the four categories discussed above; however, acute stress disorder requires that the\\nindividual experience nine symptoms across five different categories (intrusion symptoms, negative\\nmood, dissociative symptoms, avoidance symptoms, and arousal symptoms; note that in total, there are\\n14 symptoms across these five categories). For example, an individual may experience several arousal\\nand reactivity symptoms such as sleep issues, concentration issues, and hypervigilance, but does not\\nexperience issues regarding negative mood. Regardless of the category of the symptoms, so long as\\nnine symptoms are present and the symptoms cause significant distress or impairment in social,\\noccupational, and other functioning, an individual will meet the criteria for acute stress disorder.\\n \\nMaking Sense of the Disorders\\nIn relation to trauma- and stressor-related disorders, note the following:\\nDiagnosis PTSD …… if symptoms have been experienced for at least one month\\nDiagnosis acute stress disorder … if symptoms have been experienced for 3 days to one month\\n \\n5.2.3. Adjustment Disorder\\nAdjustment disorder is the least intense of the three disorders discussed so far in this module. An\\nadjustment disorder occurs following an identifiable stressor that happened within the past 3 months.\\nThis stressor can be a single event (loss of job, death of a family member) or a series of multiple\\nstressors (cancer treatment, divorce/child custody issues).\\nUnlike PTSD and acute stress disorder, adjustment disorder does not have a set of specific symptoms an\\nindividual must meet for diagnosis. Rather, whatever symptoms the individual is experiencing must be\\nrelated to the stressor and must be significant enough to impair social, occupational, or other important\\nareas of functioning and causes marked distress “…that is out of proportion to the severity or intensity\\nof the stressor” (APA, 2022, pg. 319).\\nIt should be noted that there are modifiers associated with adjustment disorder. Due to the variety of\\nbehavioral and emotional symptoms that can be present with an adjustment disorder, clinicians are\\nexpected to classify a patient’s adjustment disorder as one of the following: with depressed mood, with\\nanxiety, with mixed anxiety and depressed mood, with disturbance of conduct, with mixed disturbance\\nof emotions and conduct, or unspecified if the behaviors do not meet criteria for one of the\\naforementioned categories. Based on the individual’s presenting symptoms, the clinician will determine\\nwhich category best classifies the patient’s condition. These modifiers are also important when\\nchoosing treatment options for patients.\\n \\n5.2.4. Prolonged Grief Disorder'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n130\\nThe DSM-5 included a condition for further study called persistent complex bereavement disorder. In\\n2018, a proposal was submitted to include this category in the main text of the manual and after careful\\nreview of the literature and approval of the criteria, it was accepted in the second half of 2019 and\\nadded as a new diagnostic entity called prolonged grief disorder. Prolonged grief disorder is defined\\nas an intense yearning/longing and/or preoccupation with thoughts or memories of the deceased who\\ndied at least 12 months ago. The individual will present with at least three symptoms to include feeling\\nas though part of oneself has died, disbelief about the death, emotional numbness, feeling that life is\\nmeaningless, intense loneliness, problems engaging with friends or pursuing interests, intense\\nemotional pain, and avoiding reminders that the person has died.\\nIndividuals with prolonged grief disorder often hold maladaptive cognitions about the self, feel guilt\\nabout the death, and hold negative views about life goals and expectancy.

PTSD\\nThe national lifetime prevalence rate for PTSD using DSM-IV criteria is 6.8% for U.S. adults and 5.0% to\\n8.1% for U.S. adolescents. There are currently no definitive, comprehensive population-based data\\nusing DSM-5 though studies are beginning to emerge (APA, 2022). It should not come as a surprise that\\nthe rates of PTSD are higher among veterans and others who work in fields with high traumatic\\nexperiences (i.e., firefighters, police, EMTs, emergency room providers). In fact, PTSD rates for combat\\nveterans are estimated to be as high as 30% (NcNally, 2012). Between one-third and one-half of all\\nPTSD cases consist of rape survivors, military combat and captivity, and ethnically or politically\\nmotivated genocide (APA, 2022).\\nConcerning gender, PTSD is more prevalent among females (8% to 11%) than males (4.1% to 5.4%),\\nlikely due to their higher occurrence of exposure to traumatic experiences such as childhood sexual\\nabuse, rape, domestic abuse, and other forms of interpersonal violence. Women also experience PTSD\\nfor a longer duration. (APA, 2022). Gender differences are not found in populations where both males\\nand females are exposed to significant stressors suggesting that both genders are equally predisposed\\nto developing PTSD. Prevalence rates vary slightly across cultural groups, which may reflect differences\\nin exposure to traumatic events. More specifically, prevalence rates of PTSD are highest for African\\nAmericans, followed by Latinx Americans and European Americans, and lowest for Asian Americans\\n(Hinton & Lewis-Fernandez, 2011). According to the DSM-5-TR, there are higher rates of PTSD among\\nLatinx, African-Americans, and American Indians compared to whites, and likely due to exposure to past\\nadversity and racism and discrimination (APA, 2022).\\n \\n5.3.2. Acute Stress Disorder\\nThe prevalence rate for acute stress disorder varies across the country and by traumatic event.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n132\\nAccurate prevalence rates for acute stress disorder are difficult to determine as patients must seek\\ntreatment within 30 days of the traumatic event. Despite that, it is estimated that anywhere between\\n7-30% of individuals experiencing a traumatic event will develop acute stress disorder (National Center\\nfor PTSD). While acute stress disorder is not a good predictor of who will develop PTSD, approximately\\n50% of those with acute stress disorder do eventually develop PTSD (Bryant, 2010; Bryant, Friedman,\\nSpeigel, Ursano, & Strain, 2010).\\nAs with PTSD, acute stress disorder is more common in females than males; however, unlike PTSD,\\nthere may be some neurobiological differences in the stress response, gender differences in the\\nemotional and cognitive processing of trauma, and sociocultural factors that contribute to females\\ndeveloping acute stress disorder more often than males (APA, 2022). With that said, the increased\\nexposure to traumatic events among females may also be a strong reason why women are more likely to\\ndevelop acute stress disorder.\\n \\n5.3.3. Adjustment Disorder\\nAdjustment disorders are relatively common as they describe individuals who are having difficulty\\nadjusting to life after a significant stressor. In psychiatric hospitals in the U.S., Australia, Canada, and\\nIsrael, adjustment disorders accounted for roughly 50% of the admissions in the 1990s. It is estimated\\nthat anywhere from 5-20% of individuals in outpatient mental health treatment facilities have an\\nadjustment disorder as their principal diagnosis. Adjustment disorder has been found to be higher in\\nwomen than men (APA, 2022).\\n \\n5.3.4. Prolonged Grief Disorder\\nAs this is a new disorder, the prevalence of DSM-5 prolonged grief disorder is currently unknown. Using\\na different definition of the disorder a meta-analysis of studies across four continents suggests a pooled\\nprevalence of 9.8%. It should be noted that these studies could only be loosely compared with one\\nanother making the reported prevalence rate questionable.\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nRegarding PTSD, rates are highest among people who are likely to be exposed to high traumatic\\nevents, women, and minorities.\\nAs for acute stress disorder, prevalence rates are hard to determine since patients must seek\\nmedical treatment within 30 days, but females are more likely to develop the disorder.\\nAdjustment disorders are relatively common since they occur in individuals having trouble\\nadjusting to a significant stressor, though women tend to receive a diagnosis more than men.'),\n",

Individuals with PTSD are more likely than those\\nwithout PTSD to report clinically significant levels of depressive, bipolar, anxiety, or substance abuse-\\nrelated symptoms (APA, 2022). There is also a strong relationship between PTSD and major\\nneurocognitive disorders, which may be due to the overlapping symptoms between these disorders\\n(Neurocognitive Disorders will be covered in Module 14).\\n \\n5.4.2. Acute Stress Disorder\\nBecause 30 days after the traumatic event, acute stress disorder becomes PTSD (or the symptoms\\nremit), the comorbidity of acute stress disorder with other psychological disorders has not been studied.\\nWhile acute stress disorder and PTSD cannot be comorbid disorders, several studies have explored the\\nrelationship between the disorders to identify individuals most at risk for developing PTSD. The\\nliterature indicates roughly 80% of motor vehicle accident survivors, as well as assault victims, who met\\nthe criteria for acute stress disorder went on to develop PTSD (Brewin, Andrews, Rose, & Kirk, 1999;\\nBryant & Harvey, 1998; Harvey & Bryant, 1998).

Often following a critical or terminal medical\\ndiagnosis, an individual will meet the criteria for adjustment disorder as they process the news about\\ntheir health and the impact their new medical diagnosis will have on their life. Other psychological\\ndisorders are also diagnosed with adjustment disorder; however, symptoms of adjustment disorder must\\nbe met independently of the other psychological condition. For example, an individual with adjustment\\ndisorder with depressive mood must not meet the criteria for a major depressive episode; otherwise, the\\ndiagnosis of MDD should be made over adjustment disorder.

Biological\\nHPA axis. One theory for the development of trauma and stress-related disorders is the over-\\ninvolvement of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The HPA axis is involved in the fear-\\nproducing response, and some speculate that dysfunction within this axis is to blame for the\\ndevelopment of trauma symptoms. Within the brain, the amygdala serves as the integrative system that\\ninherently elicits the physiological response to a traumatic/stressful environmental situation. The\\namygdala sends this response to the HPA axis to prepare the body for “fight or flight.” The HPA axis\\nthen releases hormones—epinephrine and cortisol—to help the body to prepare to respond to a\\ndangerous situation (Stahl & Wise, 2008). While epinephrine is known to cause physiological symptoms\\nsuch as increased blood pressure, increased heart rate, increased alertness, and increased muscle\\ntension, to name a few, cortisol is responsible for returning the body to homeostasis once the dangerous\\nsituation is resolved.\\nResearchers have studied the amygdala and HPA axis in individuals with PTSD, and have identified\\nheightened amygdala reactivity in stressful situations, as well as excessive responsiveness to stimuli\\nthat is related to one’s specific traumatic event (Sherin & Nemeroff, 2011). Additionally, studies have\\nindicated that individuals with PTSD also show a diminished fear extinction, suggesting an overall\\nhigher level of stress during non-stressful times. These findings may explain why individuals with PTSD\\nexperience an increased startle response and exaggerated sensitivity to stimuli associated with their\\ntrauma (Schmidt, Kaltwasser, & Wotjak, 2013).\\n \\n5.5.2. Cognitive\\nPreexisting conditions of depression or anxiety may predispose an individual to develop PTSD or other\\nstress disorders. One theory is that these individuals may ruminate or over-analyze the traumatic event,\\nthus bringing more attention to the traumatic event and leading to the development of stress-related\\nsymptoms. Furthermore, negative cognitive styles or maladjusted thoughts about themselves and the\\nenvironment may also contribute to PTSD symptoms. For example, individuals who identify life events\\nas “out of their control” report more severe stress symptoms than those who feel as though they have\\nsome control over their lives (Catanesi et al., 2013).\\n \\n5.5.3. Social\\nWhile this may hold for many psychological disorders, social and family support have been identified as\\nprotective factors for individuals prone to develop PTSD. More specifically, rape victims who are loved\\nand cared for by their friends and family members as opposed to being judged for their actions before\\nthe rape, report fewer trauma symptoms and faster psychological improvement (Street et al., 2011).'),\n",

Sociocultural\\nAs was mentioned previously, different ethnicities report different prevalence rates of PTSD. While this\\nmay be due to increased exposure to traumatic events, there is some evidence to suggest that cultural\\ngroups also interpret traumatic events differently, and therefore, may be more vulnerable to the\\ndisorder. Hispanic Americans have routinely been identified as a cultural group that experiences a\\nhigher rate of PTSD. Studies ranging from combat-related PTSD to on-duty police officer stress, as well\\nas stress from a natural disaster, all identify Hispanic Americans as the cultural group experiencing the\\nmost traumatic symptoms (Kaczkurkin et al., 2016; Perilla et al., 2002; Pole et al., 2001).\\nWomen also report a higher incidence of PTSD symptoms than men. Some possible explanations for this\\ndiscrepancy are stigmas related to seeking psychological treatment, as well as a greater risk of\\nexposure to traumatic events that are associated with PTSD (Kubiak, 2006).  Studies exploring rates of\\nPTSD symptoms for military and police veterans have failed to report a significant gender difference in\\nthe diagnosis rate of PTSD suggesting that there is not a difference in the rate of occurrence of PTSD in\\nmales and females in these settings (Maguen, Luxton, Skopp, & Madden, 2012).\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nIn terms of causes for trauma- and stressor-related disorders, an over-involvement of the\\nhypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis has been cited as a biological cause, with rumination\\nand negative coping styles or maladjusted thoughts emerging as cognitive causes.\\nCulture may lead to different interpretations of traumatic events thus causing higher rates among\\nHispanic Americans.\\nSocial and family support have been found to be protective factors for individuals most likely to\\ndevelop PTSD.\\n \\nSection 5.5 Review Questions\\nDiscuss the four etiological models of the trauma- and stressor-related disorders.

Psychological Debriefing\\nOne way to negate the potential development of PTSD symptoms is thorough psychological\\ndebriefing. Psychological debriefing is considered a type of crisis intervention that requires individuals\\nwho have recently experienced a traumatic event to discuss or process their thoughts and feelings\\nrelated to the traumatic event, typically within 72 hours of the event (Kinchin, 2007). While there are a\\nfew different methods to a psychological debriefing, they all follow the same general format:\\nIdentifying the facts (what happened?)1.\\nEvaluating the individual’s thoughts and emotional reaction to the events leading up to the event,2.\\nduring the event, and then immediately following\\nNormalizing the individual’s reaction to the event3.\\nDiscussing how to cope with these thoughts and feelings, as well as creating a designated social4.\\nsupport system (Kinchin, 2007).\\nThroughout the last few decades, there has been a debate on the effectiveness of psychological\\ndebriefing. Those within the field argue that psychological debriefing is not a means to cure or prevent\\nPTSD, but rather, psychological debriefing is a means to assist individuals with a faster recovery time\\nposttraumatic event (Kinchin, 2007). Research across a variety of traumatic events (i.e., natural\\ndisasters, burns, war) routinely suggests that psychological debriefing is not helpful in either the\\nreduction of posttraumatic symptoms nor the recovery time of those with PTSD (Tuckey & Scott, 2014). \\nOne theory is these early interventions may encourage patients to ruminate on their symptoms or the\\nevent itself, thus maintaining PTSD symptoms (McNally, 2004). In efforts to combat these negative\\nfindings of psychological debriefing, there has been a large movement to provide more structure and\\ntraining for professionals employing psychological debriefing, thus ensuring that those who are\\nproviding treatment are properly trained to do so.\\n \\n5.6.2. Exposure Therapy\\nWhile exposure therapy is predominately used in anxiety disorders, it has also shown great success in\\ntreating PTSD-related symptoms as it helps individuals extinguish fears associated with the traumatic\\nevent. There are several different types of exposure techniques—imaginal, in vivo, and flooding are\\namong the most common types (Cahill, Rothbaum, Resick, & Follette, 2009).'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n138\\nIn imaginal exposure, the individual mentally re-creates specific details of the traumatic event. The\\npatient is then asked to repeatedly discuss the event in increasing detail, providing more information\\nregarding their thoughts and feelings at each step of the event. During in vivo exposure, the individual\\nis reminded of the traumatic event through the use of videos, images, or other tangible objects related\\nto the traumatic event that induces a heightened arousal response. While the patient is re-experiencing\\ncognitions, emotions, and physiological symptoms related to the traumatic experience, they are\\nencouraged to utilize positive coping strategies, such as relaxation techniques, to reduce their overall\\nlevel of anxiety.\\nImaginal exposure and in vivo exposure are generally done in a gradual process, with imaginal exposure\\nbeginning with fewer details of the event, and slowly gaining information over time. In vivo starts with\\nimages or videos that elicit lower levels of anxiety, and then the patient slowly works their way up a fear\\nhierarchy, until they are able to be exposed to the most distressing images. Another type of exposure\\ntherapy, flooding, involves disregard for the fear hierarchy, presenting the most distressing memories\\nor images at the beginning of treatment. While some argue that this is a more effective method, it is\\nalso the most distressing and places patients at risk for dropping out of treatment (Resick, Monson, &\\nRizvi, 2008).\\n \\n5.6.3. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)\\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy, as discussed in the mood disorders chapter, has been proven to be an\\neffective form of treatment for trauma/stress-related disorders. It is believed that this type of treatment\\nis effective in reducing trauma-related symptoms due to its ability to identify and challenge the negative\\ncognitions surrounding the traumatic event, and replace them with positive, more adaptive cognitions\\n(Foa et al., 2005).\\nTrauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) is an adaptation of CBT that utilizes both\\nCBT techniques and trauma-sensitive principles to address the trauma-related symptoms. According to\\nthe Child Welfare Information Gateway (CWIG; 2012), TF-CBT can be summarized via the acronym\\nPRACTICE:\\nP: Psycho-education about the traumatic event. This includes discussion about the event itself, as\\nwell as typical emotional and/or behavioral responses to the event.\\nR: Relaxation Training. Teaching the patient how to engage in various types of relaxation\\ntechniques such as deep breathing and progressive muscle relaxation.\\nA: Affect. Discussing ways for the patient to effectively express their emotions/fearsrelated to the\\ntraumatic event.\\nC: Correcting negative or maladaptive thoughts.\\nT: Trauma Narrative. This involves having the patient relive the traumatic event (verbally or\\nwritten), including as many specific details as possible.\\nI: In vivo exposure (see above).\\nC: Co-joint family session. This provides the patient with strong social support and a sense of\\nsecurity. It also allows family members to learn about the treatment so that they are able to assist\\nthe patient if necessary.\\nE: Enhancing Security. Patients are encouraged to practice the coping strategies they learn in TF-\\nCBT to prepare for when they experience these triggers out in the real world, as well as any'),\n",

Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR)\\nIn the late 1980s, psychologist Francine Shapiro found that by focusing her eyes on the waving leaves\\nduring her daily walk, her troubling thoughts resolved on their own. From this observation, she\\nconcluded that lateral eye movements facilitate the cognitive processing of traumatic thoughts\\n(Shapiro, 1989).\\nWhile EMDR has evolved somewhat since Shapiro’s first claims, the basic components of EMDR consist\\nof lateral eye movement induced by the therapist moving their index finger back and forth,\\napproximately 35 cm from the client’s face, as well as components of cognitive-behavioral therapy and\\nexposure therapy. The following 8-step approach is the standard treatment approach of EMDR (Shapiro\\n& Maxfield, 2002):\\nPatient History and Treatment Planning – Identify trauma symptoms and potential barriers to1.\\ntreatment.\\nPreparation – Psychoeducation of trauma and treatment.2.\\nAssessment – Careful and detailed evaluation of the traumatic event. Patient identifies images,3.\\ncognitions, and emotions related to the traumatic event, as well as trauma-related physiological\\nsymptoms.\\nDesensitization and Reprocessing – Holding the trauma image, cognition, and emotion in4.\\nmind, while simultaneously assessing their physiological symptoms, the patient must track the\\nclinician’s finger movement for approximately 20 seconds. At this time, the patient must “blank it\\nout” and let go of the memory.\\nInstallation of Positive Cognitions – Once the negative image, cognition, and emotions are5.\\nreduced, the patient must hold onto a positive image or thought while again tracking the\\nclinician’s finger movement for approximately 20 seconds.\\nBody Scan – Patient must identify any lingering bodily sensations while again tracking the6.\\nclinician’s fingers for a third time to discard any remaining trauma symptoms.\\nClosure – Patient is provided with positive coping strategies and relaxation techniques to assist7.\\nwith any recurrent cognitions or emotions related to the traumatic experience.\\nReevaluation – Clinician assesses if treatment goals were met. If not, schedules another treatment8.\\nsession and identifies remaining symptoms.\\nAs you can see from above, only steps 4-6 are specific to EMDR; the remaining treatment is essentially a\\ncombination of exposure therapy and cognitive-behavioral techniques. Because of the high overlap\\nbetween treatment techniques, there have been quite a few studies comparing the treatment efficacy of\\nEMDR to TF-CBT and exposure therapy. While research initially failed to identify a superior treatment,\\noften citing EMDR and TF-CBT as equally efficacious in treating PTSD symptoms (Seidler & Wagner,\\n2006), more recent studies have found that EMDR may be superior to that of TF-CBT, particularly in\\npsycho-oncology patients (Capezzani et al., 2013; Chen, Zang, Hu & Liang, 2015). While meta-analytic\\nstudies continue to debate which treatment is the most effective in treating PTSD symptoms, the World\\nHealth Organization’s (2013) publication on the Guidelines for the Management of Conditions\\nSpecifically Related to Stress, identified TF-CBT and EMDR as the only recommended treatment for\\nindividuals with PTSD.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n140\\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) says to consider EMDR for adults with a\\ndiagnosis of PTSD and who presented between 1 and 3 months after a non-combat related trauma if the\\nperson shows a preference for EMDR and to offer it to adults with a diagnosis of PTSD who have\\npresented more than three months after a non-combat related trauma. They state that EMDR for adults\\nshould (cited directly from their website):\\nbe based on a validated manual\\ntypically be provided over 8 to 12 sessions, but more if clinically indicated, for example if they\\nhave experienced multiple traumas\\nbe delivered by trained practitioners with ongoing supervision\\nbe delivered in a phased manner and include psychoeducation about reactions to trauma;\\nmanaging distressing memories and situations; identifying and treating target memories (often\\nvisual images); and promoting alternative positive beliefs about the self\\nuse repeated in-session bilateral stimulation (normally with eye movements but use other\\nmethods, including taps and tones, if preferred or more appropriate, such as for people who are\\nvisually impaired) for specific target memories until the memories are no longer distressing\\ninclude the teaching of self-calming techniques and techniques for managing flashbacks, for use\\nwithin and between sessions.\\nFor more on NICE’s PTSD guidance (2018) as it relates to EMDR, please see Sections 1.6.18 to 1.6.20:\\nhttps://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng116/chapter/Recommendations\\n \\n5.6.5. Psychopharmacological Treatment\\nWhile psychopharmacological interventions have been shown to provide some relief, particularly to\\nveterans with PTSD, most clinicians agree that resolution of symptoms cannot be accomplished without\\nimplementing exposure and/or cognitive techniques that target the physiological and maladjusted\\nthoughts maintaining the trauma symptoms. With that said, clinicians agree that psychopharmacology\\ninterventions are an effective second line of treatment, particularly when psychotherapy alone does not\\nproduce relief from symptoms.\\nAmong the most common types of medications used to treat PTSD symptoms are selective serotonin\\nreuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; Bernardy & Friedman, 2015). As previously discussed in the depression\\nchapter, SSRIs work by increasing the amount of serotonin available to neurotransmitters. Tricyclic\\nantidepressants (TCAs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are also recommended as second-\\nline treatments. Their effectiveness is most often observed in individuals who report co-occurring major\\ndepressive disorder symptoms, as well as those who do not respond to SSRIs (Forbes et al., 2010).\\nUnfortunately, due to the effective CBT and EMDR treatment options, research on\\npsychopharmacological interventions has been limited.

These symptoms are likely to appear following a significant stressor\\nor years of ongoing stress (i.e., abuse; Maldonadao & Spiegel, 2014).  Occasionally, one may experience\\ntemporary dissociative symptoms due to lack of sleep or ingestion of a substance; however, these would\\nnot qualify as a dissociative disorder due to the lack of impairment in functioning. Furthermore,\\nindividuals who suffer from acute stress disorder and PTSD often experience dissociative symptoms,\\nsuch as amnesia, numbing, flashbacks, and depersonalization/derealization. However, because of the\\nidentifiable stressor (and lack of additional symptoms listed below), they meet diagnostic criteria for a\\nstress disorder as opposed to a dissociative disorder.\\nThere are three main types of dissociative disorders: dissociative identity disorder, dissociative\\namnesia, and depersonalization/derealization disorder.\\n \\n6.1.1. Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID)\\nThe key diagnostic criteria for dissociative identity disorder is the presence of two or more distinct\\npersonality states or an experience of possession (Criteria A). How overt or covert the personality states\\nare depends on psychological motivation, stress level, cultural context, emotional resilience, and\\ninternal conflicts and dynamics (APA, 2022), and severe or prolonged stress may result in sustained\\nperiods of identify confusion/alteration. Those presenting as being possessed by spirits or demons and\\nfor a small proportion of non-possession-form cases, the alternate identifies are readily observable.\\nGenerally, though, the identities in non-possession-form dissociative identity disorder are not overtly\\ndisplayed or only subtly displayed and when they are, it is just in a minority of individuals and manifests\\nas different names, hairstyles, handwritings, wardrobes, accents, etc. If the alternate identities are not\\nobservable, their presence is identified through sudden alterations or discontinuities in the individual’s\\nsense of self and sense of agency, as well as recurrent dissociative amnesias (see the second criteria\\nbelow; APA, 2022).\\nThe second main diagnostic criteria (Criteria B) for dissociative identity disorder is that there must be a\\ngap in the recall of events, information, or trauma due to the switching of personalities. These gaps are\\nmore excessive than typical forgetting one may experience due to a lack of attention. The dissociative\\namnesia presents as gaps in autobiographical memory, lapses in memory of well-learned skills or recent\\nevents, and discovering possessions for which there is no recollection of ever owning, and can involve\\neveryday events and not just events that are stressful or traumatic.\\nIt should be noted that most possession states occurring around the world are part of broadly accepted\\ncultural or religious practice and should not be diagnosed as dissociative identity disorder (Criteria D).\\nThe possession-form identities in dissociative identity disorder manifest most often as a spirit or\\nsupernatural being taking control and the individual speaking or acting in a distinctly different way.\\nThese identities present recurrently, are involuntary and unwanted, and cause significant distress or\\nimpairment (Criteria C). Impairment varies in adults from minimal (i.e., high functioning professionals)\\nto profound. For those minimally affected, marital, family, relational, and parenting functions are more\\nlikely to be impaired by symptoms of dissociative identity disorder rather than their occupational and\\nprofessional life.'),\n",

From there, an individual may have several subpersonalities. Although it is\\nhard to identify how many subpersonalities an individual may have at one time, it is believed that there\\nare on average 15 subpersonalities for women and 8 for men (APA, 2000).\\nThe switching or shifting between personalities varies among individuals and can range from merely\\nappearing to fall asleep, to very dramatic, involving excessive bodily movements, though for most, the\\nchange is subtle and may occur with only subtle changes in overt presentation. When sudden and\\nunexpected, switching is generally precipitated by a significant stressor, as the subpersonality best\\nequipped to handle the current stressor will present. The relationship between subpersonalities varies\\nbetween individuals, with some individuals reporting knowledge of other subpersonalities while others\\nhave a one-way amnesic relationship with subpersonalities, meaning they are not aware of other\\npersonalities (Barlow & Chu, 2014). These individuals will experience episodes of “amnesia” when the\\nprimary personality is not present.\\n \\n6.1.2. Dissociative Amnesia\\nDissociative amnesia is identified by the inability to recall important autobiographical information,\\nusually of a traumatic or stressful nature. It often consists of selective amnesia for a specific event or\\nevents or generalized amnesia for identity and life history. This type of amnesia is different from what\\none would consider permanent amnesia in that the information was successfully stored in memory but\\ncannot be freely recollected. It is conceptualized as possibly being a reversible memory retrieval deficit.\\nAdditionally, individuals experiencing permanent amnesia often have a neurobiological cause, whereas\\ndissociative amnesia does not (APA, 2022).\\nThere are a few types of amnesia within dissociative amnesia. Localized amnesia, the most common\\ntype, is the inability to recall events during a specific period. The length of time within a localized\\namnesia episode can vary—it can be as short as the time immediately surrounding a traumatic event, to\\nmonths or years, should the traumatic event occur that long (as commonly seen in abuse and combat\\nsituations). Selective amnesia is, in a sense, a component of localized amnesia in that the individual\\ncan recall some, but not all, of the details during a specific period. For example, a soldier may\\nexperience dissociative amnesia during the time they were deployed, yet still have some memories of\\npositive experiences such as celebrating Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner with the members of their\\nunit. Systematized amnesia occurs when an individual fails to recall a specific category of information\\nsuch as not recalling a specific room in their childhood home.\\nConversely, some individuals experience generalized dissociative amnesia in which they have a\\ncomplete loss of memory for most or all of their life history, including their own identity, previous\\nknowledge about the world, and/or well-learned skills. Individuals who experience this amnesia\\nexperience deficits in both semantic and procedural knowledge. This means that individuals have no\\ncommon knowledge of (i.e., cannot identify letters, colors, numbers) nor can they engage in learned\\nskills (i.e., typing shoes, driving car). While generalized dissociative amnesia is extremely rare, it is also\\nextremely frightening. The onset is acute, and the individual is often found wandering in a state of\\ndisorientation. Many times, these individuals are brought into emergency rooms by law enforcement\\nfollowing a dangerous situation such as an individual wandering on a busy road.\\nThe distress and impairment suffered by those with dissociative amnesia resulting from'),\n",

Some are chronically impaired in their ability to form and\\nsustain satisfactory attachments while others are highly successful in their occupation due to\\ncompulsive overwork. And finally, a substantial subgroup of those afflicted by generalized dissociative\\namnesia develop a highly impairing, chronic autobiographical memory deficit that is not ameliorated by\\nrelearning their life history, resulting in poor overall functioning in most life domains (APA, 2022).\\n \\n6.1.3. Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder\\nDepersonalization/derealization disorder is categorized by recurrent episodes of depersonalization\\nand/or derealization. Depersonalization can be defined as a feeling of unreality or detachment from\\noneself. Individuals describe this feeling as an out-of-body experience where you are an observer of\\nyour thoughts, feelings, and physical being. Furthermore, some patients report feeling as though they\\nlack speech or motor control, thus feeling at times like a robot. Distortions of one’s physical body have\\nalso been reported, with various body parts appearing enlarged or shrunken. Emotionally, one may feel\\ndetached from their feelings, lacking the ability to feel emotions despite knowing they have them.\\nSymptoms of derealization include feelings of unreality or detachment from the world—whether it be\\nindividuals, objects, or their surroundings. For example, an individual may feel as though they are\\nunfamiliar with their surroundings, even though they are in a place they have been to many times\\nbefore. Feeling emotionally disconnected from close friends or family members whom they have strong\\nfeelings for is another common symptom experienced during derealization episodes. Sensory changes\\nhave also been reported, such as feeling as though your environment is distorted, blurry, or even\\nartificial. Distortions of time, distance, and size/shape of objects may also occur.\\nThese episodes can last anywhere from a few hours to days, weeks, or even months. The onset is\\ngenerally sudden, and like the other dissociative disorders, is often triggered by intense stress or\\ntrauma. Many individuals describe feeling like they are “crazy” or “going crazy” and fear they have\\nirreversible brain damage. They experience an altered sense of time and may be obsessed about\\nwhether they really exist.\\nAs one can imagine, depersonalization/derealization disorder can cause significant emotional distress,\\nas well as impairment in one’s daily functioning. The disorder is associated with major morbidity and\\nimpairment occurs in both interpersonal and occupational spheres due to “…the hypoemotionality with\\nothers, subjective difficulty in focusing and retaining information, and a general sense of\\ndisconnectedness form life” (APA, 2022).\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nDissociative disorders are characterized by disruption in consciousness, memory, identity,\\nemotion, perception, motor control, or behavior.

Epidemiology\\n \\nSection Learning Objectives\\nDescribe the epidemiology of dissociative disorders.\\n \\nDissociative disorders were once believed to be extremely rare; however, more recent research\\nsuggests that they may be more present in the general population than once thought. Estimates for the\\nprevalence of dissociative identity disorder in U.S. adults is 1.5%, with women predominating in adult\\nclinical settings. Symptom profiles, clinical history, and childhood trauma history show few gender\\ndifferences though women have higher rates of somatization. Research shows that dissociative amnesia\\noccurs in approximately 1.8% of the U.S. population. It is estimated that about one-half of all adults\\nhave experienced at least one episode of depersonalization/derealization during their life, however,\\nsymptomatology that meets full criteria for the disorder is markedly less common than these transient\\nsymptoms. A one-month prevalence of about 1-2% was reported in the United Kingodm (APA, 2022).\\nThe onset of dissociative disorders is generally late adolescence to early adulthood, with the exception\\nof dissociative identity disorder. Due to the high comorbidity between childhood abuse and dissociative\\nidentity disorder, it is believed that symptoms begin in early childhood following the repeated exposure\\nto abuse; however, the full onset of the disorder is not observed (or noticed by others) until adolescence\\n(Sar et al., 2014).'),\n",

Similarly, depressive disorders are also\\ncommonly found in combination with dissociative disorders, likely due to the impact the disorders have\\non social and emotional functioning. In individuals with dissociative amnesia, a wide range of emotions\\nrelated to their inability to recall memories during the episode often present once the amnesia episode\\nis in remission (APA, 2022). These emotions frequently contribute to the development of a depressive\\nepisode.\\nThere has been some evidence of comorbid somatic symptom disorder and conversion disorder,\\nparticularly for those who experience dissociative amnesia.

Cognitive'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n149\\nOne proposed cognitive theory of dissociative disorders, particularly dissociative amnesia, is a memory\\nretrieval deficit. More specifically, Kopelman (2000) theorizes that the combination of psychological\\nstress and various other biopsychosocial predispositions affects the frontal lobes executive system’s\\nability to retrieve autobiographical memories (Picard et al., 2013). Neuroimaging studies have\\nsupported this theory by showing deficits to several prefrontal regions, which is one area responsible\\nfor memory retrieval (Picard et al., 2013).   Despite these findings, there is still some debate over which\\nspecific brain regions within the executive system are responsible for the retrieval difficulties, as\\nresearch studies have reported mixed findings.\\nSpecific to dissociative identity disorder, neuroimaging studies have shown differences in hippocampus\\nactivation between subpersonalities (Tsai, Condie, Wu & Chang, 1999). As you may recall, the\\nhippocampus is responsible for storing information from short-term to long-term memory. It is\\nhypothesized that this brain region is responsible for the generation of dissociative states and amnesia\\n(Staniloiu & Markowitsch, 2010).\\n \\n6.4.3. Sociocultural\\nThe sociocultural model of dissociative disorders has been primarily influenced by Lilienfeld and\\ncolleagues (1999) who argue that the influence of mass media and its publications of dissociative\\ndisorders, provide a model for individuals to not only learn about dissociative disorders but also engage\\nin similar dissociative behaviors. This theory has been supported by the significant increase in\\ndissociative identity disorder cases after the publication of Sybil, a documentation of a woman’s 16\\nsubpersonalities (Goff & Simms, 1993).\\nThese mass media productions are not just suggestive to patients. It has been suggested that mass\\nmedia also influences the way clinicians gather information regarding dissociative symptoms of\\npatients. For example, therapists may unconsciously use questions or techniques in session that evoke\\ndissociative types of problems in their patient following exposure to a media source discussing\\ndissociative disorders.\\n   \\n6.4.4. Psychodynamic\\nThe psychodynamic theory of dissociative disorders assumes that dissociative disorders are caused by\\nan individual’s repressed thoughts and feelings related to an unpleasant or traumatic event\\n(Richardson, 1998). In blocking these thoughts and feelings, the individual is subconsciously protecting\\nhimself from painful memories.\\nWhile a single incidence of repression may explain dissociative amnesia, psychodynamic theorists\\nbelieve that dissociative identity disorder results from repeated exposure to traumatic experiences,\\nsuch as childhood abuse, neglect, or abandonment (Dalenberg et al., 2012). According to the\\npsychodynamic perspective, children who experience repeated traumatic events such as physical abuse\\nor parental neglect lack the support and resources to cope with these experiences. To escape from their\\ncurrent situation, children develop different personalities to essentially flee the dangerous situation\\nthey are in.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n151\\ndisorders has offered limited opportunities for research on both the development and effectiveness of\\ntreatment methods. Due to the differences between dissociative disorders, treatment options will be\\ndiscussed specific to each disorder.\\n \\n6.5.1. Dissociative Identity Disorder\\nThe ultimate treatment goal for dissociative identity disorder is the integration of subpersonalities to\\nthe point of final fusion (Chu et al., 2011). Integration refers to the ongoing process of merging\\nsubpersonalities into one personality. Psychoeducation is paramount for integration, as the individual\\nmust understand their disorder, as well as acknowledge their subpersonalities. As mentioned above,\\nmany individuals have a one-way amnesic relationship with the subpersonalities, meaning they are not\\naware of one another. Therefore, the clinician must first make the individual aware of the various\\nsubpersonalities that present across different situations.\\nAchieving integration requires several steps. First, the clinician needs to build a relationship and strong\\nrapport with the primary personality. From there, the clinician can begin to encourage communication\\nand coordination between the subpersonalities gradually. Making the subpersonalities aware of one\\nanother, as well as addressing their conflicts, is an essential component of the integration of\\nsubpersonalities, and the core of dissociative identity disorder treatment (Chu et al., 2011).\\nOnce the individual is aware of their personalities, treatment can continue with the goal of fusion.\\nFusion occurs when two or more alternate identities join (Chu et al., 2011). When this happens, there is\\na complete loss of separateness. Depending on the number of subpersonalities, this process can take\\nquite a while. Once all subpersonalities are fused and the individual identifies themselves as one unified\\nself, it is believed the patient has reached final fusion.\\nIt should be noted that final fusion is difficult to obtain. As you can imagine, some patients do not find\\nfinal fusion a desirable outcome, particularly those with harrowing histories; chronic, severe stressors;\\nadvanced age; and comorbid medical and psychiatric disorders, to name a few. For individuals where\\nfinal fusion is not the treatment goal, the clinician may work toward resolution or sufficient integration\\nand coordination of subpersonalities that allows the individual to function independently (Chu et al.,\\n2011). Unfortunately, individuals that do not achieve final fusion are at greater risk for relapse of\\nsymptoms, particularly those with whose dissociative identity disorder appears to stem from traumatic\\nexperiences.\\nOnce an individual reaches final fusion, ongoing treatment is essential to maintain this status. In\\ngeneral, treatment focuses on social and positive coping skills. These skills are particularly helpful for\\nindividuals with a history of traumatic events, as it can help them process these events, as well as help\\nprevent future relapses.\\n \\n6.5.2. Dissociative Amnesia\\nAs previously mentioned, many individuals regain memory without the need for treatment; however,\\nthere is a small population that does require additional treatment. While there is no evidenced-based\\ntreatment for dissociative amnesia, both hypnosis and phasic therapy have been shown to produce some'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n152\\npositive effects in patients with dissociative amnesia.\\n     6.5.2.1. Hypnosis. One theory of dissociative amnesia is that it is a form of self-hypnosis and that\\nindividuals hypnotize themselves to forget information or events that are unpleasant (Dell, 2010).\\nBecause of this theory, one type of treatment that has routinely been implemented for individuals with\\ndissociative amnesia is hypnosis. Through hypnosis, the clinician can help the individual contain,\\nmodulate, and reduce the intensity of the amnesia symptoms, thus allowing them to process the\\ntraumatic or unpleasant events underlying the amnesia episode (Maldonadao & Spiegel, 2014). To do\\nthis, the clinician will encourage the patient to think of memories just before the amnesic episode as\\nthough it was the present time. The clinician will then slowly walk them through the events during the\\namnesic period to reorient the individual to experience these events. This technique is essentially a way\\nto encourage a controlled recall of dissociated memories, something that is particularly helpful when\\nthe memories include traumatic experiences (Maldonadao & Spiegel, 2014).\\nAnother form of “hypnosis” is the use of barbiturates, also known as “truth serums,” to help relax the\\nindividual and free their inhibitions. Although not always effective, the theory is that these drugs reduce\\nthe anxiety surrounding the unpleasant events enough to allow the individual to recall and process\\nthese memories in a safe environment (Ahern et al., 2000).\\n \\n6.5.3. Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder\\nDepersonalization/derealization disorder symptoms generally occur for an extensive period before the\\nindividual seeks out treatment. Because of this, there is some evidence to support that the diagnosis\\nalone is effective in reducing symptom intensity, as it also relieves the individual’s anxiety surrounding\\nthe baffling nature of the symptoms (Medford, Sierra, Baker, & David, 2005).\\nDue to the high comorbidity of depersonalization/derealization disorder with anxiety and depression,\\nthe goal of treatment is often alleviating these secondary mental health symptoms related to the\\ndepersonalization/derealization symptoms. While there has been some evidence to suggest treatment\\nwith an SSRI is effective in improving mood, the evidence for a combined treatment method of\\npsychopharmacological and psychological treatment is even more compelling (Medford, Sierra, Baker,\\n& David, 2005). The psychological treatment of preference is cognitive-behavioral therapy as it\\naddresses the negative attributions and appraisals contributing to the depersonalization/derealization\\nsymptoms (Medford, Sierra, Baker, & David, 2005). By challenging these catastrophic attributions in\\nresponse to stressful situations, the individual can reduce overall anxiety levels, which consequently\\nreduces depersonalization/ derealization symptoms.\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nTreatment for dissociative identity disorder involves the integration of subpersonalities to the\\npoint of final fusion and takes several steps to achieve.\\nFor some patients, this is not possible as they do not find final fusion to be a desirable outcome.'),\n",

How do we distinguish fear from anxiety? The DSM says that fear is an\\nemotional response to a real or perceived imminent threat which leads to “…surges of autonomic\\narousal necessary for flight or flight, thoughts of immediate danger, and escape behaviors.” Anxiety, on\\nthe other hand, is the anticipation of a future threat leading to, “…muscle tension and vigilance in\\npreparation for future danger and cautious or avoidant behaviors” (APA, 2022, pg. 215). The anxiety\\ndisorders differ from one another in the types of objects or situations that lead to fear, anxiety, or\\navoidance behavior. We will cover generalized anxiety disorder, specific phobia, agoraphobia, social\\nanxiety disorder, and panic disorder.\\n \\n7.1.1. Generalized Anxiety Disorder\\nGeneralized anxiety disorder is characterized by an underlying excessive anxiety and worry related\\nto a wide range of events or activities and lasting for more days than not for at least six months. While\\nmany individuals experience some degree of worry throughout the day, individuals with generalized\\nanxiety disorder experience worry of greater intensity and for longer periods than the average person\\n(APA, 2022). Additionally, they are often unable to control their worry through various coping\\nstrategies, which directly interferes with their ability to engage in daily social and occupational tasks.\\nTo receive a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder, three or more of the following somatic symptoms\\nmust be present in adults as well: restlessness, fatigue, difficultly concentrating, irritability, muscle\\ntension, and problems sleeping (APA, 2022; Gelenberg, 2000).\\n \\n7.1.2. Specific Phobia\\nSpecific phobia is distinguished by fear or anxiety specific to an object or a situation. While the\\namount of fear or anxiety related to the specific object or situation varies among individuals, it also\\nvaries related to the proximity of the object or situation. When individuals are face-to-face with their\\nspecific phobia, immediate fear is present, and the phobic object or situation is actively avoided or\\nendured. It should also be noted that these fears are excessive and irrational, often severely impacting\\none’s daily functioning. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, lasting at least six months (APA,\\n2022).\\nIndividuals can experience multiple specific phobias at the same time. In fact, nearly 75% of individuals\\nwith a specific phobia report fear of more than one object and the average individual fears three or\\nmore objects or situations (APA, 2022).  When making a diagnosis of specific phobia, it is important to\\nidentify the stimulus. Among the most diagnosed specific phobias are animals, natural environment\\n(height, storms, water), blood-injection-injury (needles, invasive medical procedures), or situational\\n(airplanes, elevators, enclosed places). In terms of gender differences, women predominantly\\nexperience animal, natural environment, and situational specific phobias while blood-injection-injury\\nphobia is experienced by both men and women equally (APA, 2022).'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n157\\n \\n7.1.3. Agoraphobia\\nAgoraphobia is defined as intense fear or anxiety triggered by two or more of the following: using\\npublic transportation such as planes, trains, ships, buses; being in large, open spaces such as parking\\nlots or on bridges; being in enclosed spaces like stores or movie theaters; being in a crowd or standing\\nin line; or being outside of the home alone. The individual fears or avoids these situations because they\\nbelieve something terrible may occur and due to concern over not being able to escape or help not\\nbeing available (APA, 2022). Active avoidance of the situations occurs and can be behavioral such as\\nchanging daily routines or using delivery to avoid entering a restaurant or cognitive such as using\\ndistraction to bear with an agoraphobic situation. The avoidance can result in the person being\\nhomebound. The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger they pose and has been\\npresent for at least six months.\\n \\n7.1.4. Social Anxiety Disorder\\nFor social anxiety disorder, the anxiety or fear relates to social situations, particularly those in which\\nan individual can be evaluated by others. More specifically, the individual is worried that they will be\\njudged negatively and viewed as stupid, anxious, crazy, boring, or unlikeable, to name a few. Some\\nindividuals report feeling concerned that their anxiety symptoms will be obvious to others via blushing,\\nstuttering, sweating, trembling, etc. These fears severely limit an individual’s behavior in social settings\\nand have occurred for six months or more.\\nTo explain social anxiety in greater detail, let’s review the story of Mary. Mary reported the onset of her\\nsocial anxiety disorder in early elementary school when teachers would call on students to read parts of\\ntheir textbook aloud. Mary stated that she was fearful of making mistakes while reading and to alleviate\\nthis anxiety, she would read several sections ahead of the class to prepare for her turn to read aloud.\\nDespite her preparedness, one day in 5th grade, Mary was called to read, and she stumbled on a few\\nwords. While none of her classmates realized her mistake, Mary was extremely embarrassed and\\nreported higher levels of anxiety during future read aloud moments in school. In fact, when she was\\ncalled upon, Mary stated she would completely freeze up and not talk at all. After a few moments of not\\nspeaking, her teacher would skip Mary and ask another student to read her section. It took several\\nyears and a very supportive teacher for Mary to begin reading aloud in class again.\\nLike Mary, individuals with social anxiety disorder report that all or nearly all social situations provoke\\nthis intense fear. Some individuals even report significant anticipatory fear days or weeks before a\\nsocial event is to occur. This anticipatory fear often leads to avoidance of social events in some\\nindividuals; others will attend social events with a marked fear of possible threats. Because of these\\nfears, there is a significant impact on one’s social and occupational functioning.\\nIt is important to note that the cognitive interpretation of these social events is often excessive and out\\nof proportion to the actual risk of being negatively evaluated. As we saw in Mary’s case, when she\\nstumbled upon her words while reading to the class, none of her peers even noticed her mistake.\\nSituations in which individuals experience anxiety toward a real threat, such as bullying or ostracizing,\\nwould not be diagnosed with social anxiety disorder as the negative evaluation and threat are real.'),\n",

Panic Disorder\\nPanic disorder consists of a series of recurrent, unexpected panic attacks coupled with the fear of\\nfuture panic attacks. A panic attack is defined as a sudden or abrupt surge of fear or impending doom\\nalong with at least four physical or cognitive symptoms. Physical symptoms include heart palpitations,\\nsweating, trembling or shaking, shortness of breath, feeling as though they are being choked, chest\\npain, nausea, dizziness, chills or heat sensations, and numbness/tingling. Cognitive symptoms may\\nconsist of feelings of derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (feelings of being\\ndetached from oneself), the fear of losing control or ‘going crazy,’ or the fear of dying (APA, 2022).\\nWhile symptoms generally peak within a few minutes, it seems much longer for the individual\\nexperiencing the panic attack.\\nThere are two key components to panic disorder—the attacks are unexpected, meaning there is nothing\\nthat triggers them, and they are recurrent, meaning they occur multiple times. Because these panic\\nattacks occur frequently and are primarily “out of the blue,” they cause significant worry or anxiety in\\nthe individual as they are unsure of when the next attack will happen. In contrast to unexpected there\\nare also expected panic attacks, or those that have an obvious trigger. The DSM-5-TR states that\\npresence of expected panic attacks does not rule out the diagnosis of panic disorder as about half of\\nindividuals diagnosed with the disorder in the United States and Europe have both types of attacks\\n(APA, 2022).\\nIn some individuals, significant behavioral changes such as fear of leaving their home or attending large\\nevents occur as the individual is fearful an attack will happen in one of these situations, causing\\nembarrassment. Additionally, individuals report worry that others will think they are “going crazy” or\\nlosing control if they were to observe an individual experiencing a panic attack. Occasionally, an\\nadditional diagnosis of agoraphobia is given to an individual with panic disorder if their behaviors meet\\ndiagnostic criteria for this disorder as well.\\nThe frequency and intensity of these panic attacks vary widely among individuals. Some people report\\npanic attacks occurring once a week for months on end, others report more frequent attacks multiple\\ntimes a day, but then experience weeks or months without any attacks. The intensity of symptoms also\\nvaries among individuals, with some patients experiencing four or more symptoms (full-symptom) or\\nless than four (limited-symptom. Furthermore, individuals report variability within their panic attack\\nsymptoms, with some panic attacks presenting with more symptoms than others. To be diagnosed with\\npanic disorder, the individual must present with more than one unexpected full-symptom panic attack\\n(APA, 2022).\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nAll anxiety disorders share the hallmark symptoms of excessive fear or worry related to behavioral\\ndisturbances.\\nGeneralized anxiety disorder is characterized by an underlying excessive worry related to a wide'),\n",

Social Anxiety Disorder\\nAmong the most common comorbid diagnoses with a social anxiety disorder are other anxiety-related\\ndisorders, major depressive disorder, and substance-related disorders. The high comorbidity rate\\namong anxiety-related disorders and substance-related disorders is likely connected to the efforts of\\nself-medicating to deal with social fears. For example, an individual with social anxiety disorder may\\nconsume more alcohol in social settings in efforts to alleviate the anxiety of the social situation.

Biological\\n     7.4.1.1. Biological – Genetic influences. While genetics have been known to contribute to the\\npresentation of anxiety symptoms, the interaction between genetics and stressful environmental\\ninfluences appears to account for more anxiety disorders than genetics alone (Bienvenu, Davydow, &\\nKendler, 2011). The quest to identify specific genes that may predispose individuals to develop anxiety\\ndisorders has led researchers to the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR). Mutation of the 5-HTTLPR\\ngene is related to a reduction in serotonin activity and an increase in anxiety-related personality traits\\n(Munafo, Brown, & Hairiri, 2008).\\n     7.4.1.2. Biological – Neurobiological structures. Researchers have identified several brain\\nstructures and pathways that are likely responsible for anxiety responses. Among those structures is the\\namygdala, the area of the brain that is responsible for storing memories related to emotional events\\n(Gorman, Kent, Sullivan, & Coplan, 2000). When presented with a fearful situation, the amygdala\\ninitiates a reaction to ready the body for a response. First, the amygdala triggers the hypothalamic-\\npituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis to prepare for immediate action— either to fight or flight. The second\\npathway is activated by the feared stimulus itself, by sending a sensory signal to the hippocampus and\\nprefrontal cortex, to determine if the threat is real or imagined. If it is determined that no threat is\\npresent, the amygdala sends a calming response to the HPA axis, thus reducing the level of fear. If a\\nthreat is present, the amygdala is activated, producing a fear response.\\nSpecific to panic disorder is the implication of the locus coeruleus, the brain structure that serves as\\nan “on-off” switch for norepinephrine neurotransmitters. It is believed that increased activation of the\\nlocus coeruleus results in panic-like symptoms; therefore, individuals with panic disorder may have a\\nhyperactive locus coeruleus, leaving them more susceptible to experience more intense and frequent'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n164\\nphysiological arousal than the general public (Gorman, Kent, Sullivan, & Coplan, 2000). This theory is\\nsupported by studies in which individuals experienced increased panic symptoms following the injection\\nof norepinephrine (Bourin, Malinge, & Guitton, 1995).\\nUnfortunately, norepinephrine and the locus coeruleus fail to fully explain the development of panic\\ndisorder, as treatment would be much easier if only norepinephrine was implicated. Therefore,\\nresearchers argue that a more complex neuropathway is likely responsible for the development of panic\\ndisorder. More specifically, the corticostriatal-thalamocortical (CSTC) circuit, also known as the\\nfear-specific circuit, is theorized as a major contributor to panic symptoms (Gutman, Gorman, & Hirsch,\\n2004). When an individual is presented with a frightening object or situation, the amygdala is activated,\\nsending a fear response to the anterior cingulate cortex and the orbitofrontal cortex. Additional\\nprojection from the amygdala to the hypothalamus activates endocrinologic responses to fear, releasing\\nadrenaline and cortisol to help prepare the body to fight or flight (Gutman, Gorman, & Hirsch, 2004).\\nThis complex pathway supports the theory that panic disorder is mediated by several neuroanatomical\\nstructures and their associated neurotransmitters.\\n \\n 7.4.2. Psychological\\n     7.4.2.1. Psychological – Cognitive. The cognitive perspective on the development of anxiety\\nrelated disorders centers around dysfunctional thought patterns. As seen in depression, maladaptive\\nassumptions are routinely observed in individuals with anxiety-related disorders, as they often engage\\nin interpreting events as dangerous or overreacting to potentially stressful events, which contributes to\\nan overall heightened anxiety level. These negative appraisals, in combination with a biological\\npredisposition to anxiety, likely contribute to the development of anxiety symptoms (Gallagher et al.,\\n2013).\\nSensitivity to physiological arousal not only contributes to anxiety disorders in general, but also for\\npanic disorder where individuals experience various physiological sensations and misinterpret them as\\ncatastrophic. One explanation for this theory is that individuals with panic disorder are more\\nsusceptible to more frequent and intensive physiological symptoms than the general public (Nillni,\\nRohan, & Zvolensky, 2012). Others argue that these individuals have had more trauma-related\\nexperiences in the past, and therefore, are quick to misevaluate their symptoms as a potential threat.\\nThis misevaluation of symptoms as impending disaster likely maintain symptoms as the cognitive\\nmisinterpretations to physiological arousal creates a negative feedback loop, leading to more\\nphysiological changes.\\nSocial anxiety is also primarily explained by cognitive theorists. Individuals with social anxiety disorder\\ntend to hold unattainable or extremely high social beliefs and expectations. Furthermore, they often\\nengage in preconceived maladaptive assumptions that they will behave incompetently in social\\nsituations and that their behaviors will lead to terrible consequences. Because of these beliefs, they\\nanticipate social disasters will occur and, therefore, avoid social encounters (or limit them to close\\nfriends/family members) in efforts to prevent the disaster (Moscovitch et al., 2013). Unfortunately,\\nthese cognitive appraisals are not only isolated to before and during the event. Individuals with social\\nanxiety disorder will also evaluate the social event after it has taken place, often obsessively reviewing\\nthe details. This overestimation of social performance negatively reinforces future avoidance of social\\nsituations.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n165\\n     7.4.2.2. Psychological – Behavioral. The behavioral explanation for the development of anxiety\\ndisorders is mainly reserved for phobias—both specific and social phobia. More precisely, behavioral\\ntheorists focus on respondent conditioning – when two events that occur close together become\\nstrongly associated with one another, despite their lack of causal relationship (see Module 2 for an\\nexplanation of respondent conditioning). Watson and Rayner’s (1920) infamous Little Albert experiment\\nis an example of how respondent conditioning can be used to induce fear through associations. In this\\nstudy, Little Albert developed a fear of white rats by pairing a white rat with a loud sound. This\\nexperiment, although lacking ethical standards, was groundbreaking in the development of learned\\nbehaviors. Over time, researchers have been able to replicate these findings (in more ethically sound\\nways) to provide further evidence of the role of respondent conditioning in the development of phobias.\\n     7.4.2.3. Psychological – Modeling is another behavioral explanation of the development of\\nspecific and social phobias. In modeling, an individual acquires a fear though observation and imitation\\n(Bandura & Rosenthal, 1966). For example, when a young child observes their parent display irrational\\nfear of an animal, the child may then begin to display similar behavior. Similarly, seeing another\\nindividual being ridiculed in a social setting may increase the chances of developing social anxiety, as\\nthe individual may become fearful that they would experience a similar situation in the future. It is\\nspeculated that the maintenance of these phobias is due to the avoidance of the feared item or social\\nsetting, thus preventing the individual from learning that the object or situation is not something that\\nshould be feared.\\nWhile modeling and respondent conditioning largely explain the development of phobias, there is some\\nspeculation that the accumulation of many these learned fears will develop into generalized anxiety\\ndisorder. Through stimulus generalization, or the tendency for the conditioned stimulus to evoke\\nsimilar responses to other stimuli, a fear of one stimulus (such as the dog) may become generalized to\\nother items (such as all animals). As these fears begin to grow, a more generalized anxiety will present,\\nas opposed to a specific phobia.\\n \\n7.4.3. Sociocultural\\nSeeing how prominent the biological and psychological constructs are in explaining the development of\\nanxiety-related disorders, we also need to review the social constructs that contribute and maintain\\nanxiety disorders. While characteristics such as living in poverty, experiencing significant daily\\nstressors, and increased exposure to traumatic events are all identified as significant contributors to\\nanxiety disorders, additional sociocultural influences such as gender and discrimination have also\\nreceived considerable attention, mainly due to the epidemiological nature of the disorder.\\nGender has largely been researched within anxiety disorders due to the consistent discrepancy in the\\ndiagnosis rate between men and women. As previously discussed, women are routinely diagnosed with\\nanxiety disorders more often than men, a trend that is observed throughout the entire lifespan. One\\npotential explanation for this discrepancy is the influence of social pressures on women. Women are\\nmore susceptible to experience traumatic experiences throughout their life, which may contribute to\\nanxious appraisals of future events. Furthermore, women are more likely to use emotion-focused\\ncoping, which is less effective in reducing distress than problem-focused coping (McLean &\\nAnderson, 2009). These factors may increase levels of stress hormones within women that leave them\\nsusceptible to develop symptoms of anxiety. Therefore, it appears a combination of genetic,'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n166\\nenvironmental, and social factors may explain why women tend to be diagnosed more often with\\nanxiety-related disorders.\\nExposure to discrimination and prejudice, particularly relevant to ethnic minorities and other\\nmarginalized groups, can also impact an individual’s anxiety level. Discrimination and prejudice\\ncontribute to negative interactions, which is directly related to negative affect and an overall decline in\\nmental health (Gibbons et al., 2014). The repeated exposure to discrimination and prejudice over time\\ncan lead to fear responses in individuals, along with subsequent avoidance of social situations in efforts\\nto protect themselves emotionally.\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nBiological causes of anxiety disorders include the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR); brain\\nstructures to include the amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex; and the locus coeruleus\\nand corticostriatal-thalamocortical (CSTC) circuit in relation to panic disorder.\\nPsychological causes of anxiety disorders include maladaptive assumptions, the linking of events\\nthrough respondent conditioning, modeling, and stimulus generalization as it relates to\\ngeneralized anxiety disorder.\\nSociocultural causes of anxiety disorders include social pressures leading to a higher rate of\\ndiagnosis for women and discrimination and prejudice which affects ethnic minorities and other\\nmarginalized groups.\\n \\nSection 7.4 Review Questions\\nDiscuss the biological etiology of panic disorders.

Generalized Anxiety Disorder\\n     7.5.1.1. Psychopharmacology. Benzodiazepines, a class of sedative-hypnotic drugs that will be\\ndiscussed in more detail in the substance abuse module, originally replaced barbiturates as the leading\\nanti-anxiety medication due to their less addictive nature, yet equally effective ability to calm\\nindividuals at low dosages. Unfortunately, as more research was done on benzodiazepines, serious side\\neffects, as well as physical dependence of benzodiazepines at large dosages, has routinely been\\ndocumented (NIMH, 2013). Due to these negative effects, selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors\\n(SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are generally considered to be first-\\nline medication options for those with generalized anxiety disorder. Findings indicate a 30-50% positive\\nresponse rate to these psychopharmacological interventions (Reinhold & Rickels, 2015). Unfortunately,\\nnone of these medications continue to provide any benefit once they are stopped; therefore, other\\neffective treatment options such as CBT, relaxation training, and biofeedback are often encouraged\\nbefore the use of pharmacological interventions.\\n     7.5.1.2. Rational-Emotive therapy. Albert Ellis developed rational emotive therapy in the\\nmid-1950s as one of the first forms of cognitive-behavioral therapy. Ellis proposed that individuals were\\nnot aware of the effect their negative thoughts had on their behaviors and various relationships, and\\nthus, established a treatment to address these thoughts and provide relief to those suffering from\\nanxiety and depression. The goal of rational emotive therapy is to identify irrational, self-defeating\\nassumptions, challenge the rationality of those assumptions, and to replace them with new, more\\nproductive thoughts and feelings. By identifying and replacing these assumptions, the individual will\\nexperience relief of generalized anxiety disorder symptoms (Ellis, 2014).\\n     7.5.1.3. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). CBT is discussed in detail in the Mood Disorder\\nModule; however, it is also among the most effective treatment options for a variety of anxiety\\ndisorders, including generalized anxiety disorder. Findings suggest 60 percent of individuals report a\\nsignificant reduction/elimination in anxious thoughts one-year post treatment (Hanrahan, Field, Jones,\\n& Davy, 2013). The fundamental goal of CBT is a combination of cognitive and behavioral strategies\\naimed to identify and restructure maladaptive thoughts while also providing opportunities to utilize\\nthese more effective thought patterns through exposure-based experiences. Through repetition, the\\nindividual will be able to identify and replace anxious thoughts outside of therapy sessions, ultimately\\nreducing their overall anxiety levels (Borkovec, & Ruscio, 2001).\\n     7.5.1.4. Biofeedback. Biofeedback provides a visual representation of a patient’s physiological\\narousal. To achieve this feedback, a patient is connected to a computer that provides continuous\\ninformation on their physiological states. There are several ways a patient can connect to the computer.\\nAmong the most common is electromyography (EMG). EMG measures the amount of muscle activity\\ncurrently experienced by the individual. An electrode is placed on a patient’s skin just above a major\\nmuscle group, usually the forearm or the forehead. Other common areas of measurement are'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n168\\nelectroencephalography (EEG), which measures the neurofeedback or brain activity; heart rate\\nvariability (HRV), which measures autonomic activity such as heart rate or blood pressure; and\\ngalvanic skin response (GSR) which measures sweat.\\nOnce the patient is connected to the biofeedback machine, the clinician can walk the patient through a\\nseries of relaxation scripts or techniques as the computer simultaneously measures the changes in\\nmuscle tension. The theory behind biofeedback is that in providing a patient with a visual\\nrepresentation of changes in their physiological state, they become more skilled at voluntarily reducing\\ntheir physiological arousal, and thus, their overall sense of anxiety or stress. While research has\\nidentified only a modest effect of biofeedback on anxiety levels, patients do report a positive experience\\nwith the treatment due to the visual feedback of their physiological arousal (Brambrink, 2004).\\n \\n7.5.2. Specific Phobias\\n     7.5.2.1. Exposure treatments. While there are many treatment options for specific phobias,\\nresearch routinely supports the behavioral techniques as the most effective treatment strategies.\\nSeeing as the behavioral theory suggests phobias develop via respondent conditioning, the treatment\\napproach revolves around breaking the maladaptive association between the object and fear. This is\\ngenerally accomplished through exposure treatments. As the name implies, the individual is exposed\\nto their feared stimuli. This can be done in several different approaches: systematic desensitization,\\nflooding, and modeling.\\nSystematic desensitization is an exposure technique that utilizes relaxation strategies to help calm\\nthe individual as they are presented with the fearful object. The notion behind this technique is that\\nboth fear and relaxation cannot exist at the same time; therefore, the individual learns how to replace\\ntheir fearful reaction with a calm, relaxing reaction.\\nTo begin, the patient, with assistance from the clinician, will identify a fear hierarchy, or a list of feared\\nobjects/situations ordered from least fearful to most fearful. After teaching several different types of\\nrelaxation techniques, the clinician will present items from the fear hierarchy, starting from the least\\nfearful object/subject, while the patient practices using the learned relaxation techniques. The\\npresentation of the feared object/situation can be in person—in vivo exposure—or it can be\\nimagined—imaginal exposure. Imaginal exposure tends to be less intensive than in vivo exposure;\\nhowever, it is less effective than in vivo exposure in eliminating the phobia. Depending on the phobia, in\\nvivo exposure may not be an option, such as with a fear of a tornado. Once the patient can effectively\\nemploy relaxation techniques to reduce their anxiety to a manageable level, the clinician will slowly\\nmove up the fear hierarchy until the individual does not experience excessive fear of all objects on the\\nlist.\\n Flooding is another exposure technique in which the clinician does not utilize a fear hierarchy, but\\nrather repeatedly exposes the individual to their most feared object or situation. Similar to systematic\\ndesensitization, flooding can be done in either in vivo or imaginal exposure. Clearly, this technique is\\nmore intensive than systematic or gradual exposure to feared objects. Because of this, patients are at a\\ngreater likelihood of dropping out of treatment, thus not successfully overcoming their phobias.\\n Modeling is another common technique used to treat phobias (Kelly, Barker, Field, Wilson, &\\nReynolds, 2010). In this technique, the clinician approaches the feared object/subject while the patient'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n169\\nobserves. As the name implies, the clinician models appropriate behaviors when exposed to the feared\\nstimulus, showing that the phobia is irrational. After modeling several times, the clinician encourages\\nthe patient to confront the feared stimulus with the clinician, and then ultimately, without the clinician.\\n \\n7.5.3. Agoraphobia\\nSimilar to the treatment approaches for specific phobias, exposure-based techniques are among the\\nmost effective treatment options for individuals with agoraphobia. However, unlike the high success\\nrate in specific phobias, exposure treatment for agoraphobia has been less effective in providing\\ncomplete relief from the disorder. The success rate may be impacted by the high comorbidity rate of\\nagoraphobia and panic disorder. Because of the additional presentation of panic symptoms, exposure\\ntreatments alone are not the most effective in eliminating symptoms as residual panic symptoms often\\nremain (Craske & Barlow, 2014). Therefore, the best treatment approach for those with agoraphobia\\nand panic disorder is a combination of exposure and CBT techniques (see panic disorder  treatment).\\nFor individuals with agoraphobia without panic symptoms, the use of group therapy in combination with\\nindividual exposure therapy has been identified as a successful treatment option. The group therapy\\nformat allows the individual to engage in exposure-based field trips to various community locations,\\nwhile also maintaining a sense of support and security from a group of individuals whom they know.\\nResearch indicates that this type of treatment provides improvement for nearly 60 to 80 percent of\\npatients with agoraphobia; however, there is a relatively high rate of partial relapse, suggesting that\\nlong-term treatment or booster sessions should continue for several years at minimum (Craske &\\nBarlow, 2014).\\n \\n7.5.4. Social Anxiety Disorder\\n     7.5.4.1. Exposure. A hallmark treatment approach for all anxiety disorders is exposure. Specific to\\nsocial anxiety disorder, the individual is encouraged to engage in social situations where they are likely\\nto experience increased anxiety. Initially, the clinician will role-play various social situations with the\\npatient so they can practice social interactions in a safe, controlled environment (Rodebaugh, Holaway,\\n& Heimberg, 2004). As the patient becomes habituated to the interaction with the clinician, the\\nclinician and patient may venture outside of the treatment room and engage in social situations with\\nrandom strangers at various locations such as fast-food restaurants, local stores, libraries, etc. The\\npatient is encouraged to continue with these exposures outside of treatment to help reduce anxiety\\nrelated to social situations.\\n     7.5.4.2. Social skills training. This treatment is specific to social anxiety disorder as it focuses on\\nthe patient’s skill deficits or inadequate social interactions that contribute to their negative social\\nexperiences and anxiety. During a session, the clinician may use a combination of skills such as\\nmodeling, corrective feedback, and positive reinforcement to provide feedback and encouragement to\\nthe patient regarding their behavioral interactions (Rodebaugh, Holaway, & Heimberg, 2004). By\\nincorporating the clinician’s feedback into their social repertoire, the patient can engage in positive\\nsocial behaviors outside of the treatment room and improve their overall social interactions while\\nreducing ongoing social anxiety.'),\n",

While exposure and social skills training are suitable treatment\\noptions, research routinely supports the need to incorporate cognitive restructuring as an additive\\ncomponent in treatment to provide substantial symptom reduction. Like cognitive restructuring\\npreviously discussed in the Mood Disorder module, the clinician will work with the therapist to identify\\nnegative, automatic thoughts that contribute to the distress in social situations. The clinician can then\\nhelp the patient establish new, positive thoughts to replace these negative thoughts. Research indicates\\nthat implementing cognitive restructuring techniques before, during, and after exposure sessions\\nenhances the overall effects of treatment of social anxiety disorder (Heimberg & Becker, 2002).\\n \\n7.5.5. Panic Disorder\\n     7.5.5.1. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). CBT is the most effective treatment option for\\nindividuals with panic disorder as the focus is on correcting misinterpretations of bodily sensations\\n(Craske & Barlow, 2014). Nearly 80 percent of people with panic disorder report complete remission of\\nsymptoms after mastering the following five components of CBT for panic disorder (Craske & Barlow,\\n2014).\\nPsychoeducation. Treatment begins by educating the patient on the nature of panic disorder, the\\nunderlying causes of panic disorder, as well as the mechanisms that maintain the disorder such as the\\nphysical, cognitive, and behavioral response systems (Craske & Barlow, 2014). This part of treatment is\\nfundamental in correcting any myths or misconceptions about panic symptoms, as they often contribute\\nto the exacerbation of panic symptoms.\\nSelf-monitoring. Self-monitoring, or the act of self-observation, is essential to the CBT treatment\\nprocess for panic disorder. In this part of treatment, the individual is taught to identify the physiological\\ncues immediately leading up to and during a panic attack.  Then, the patient is encouraged to recognize\\nand document the thoughts and behaviors associated with these physiological symptoms. By bringing\\nawareness to the symptoms, as well as the relationship between physical arousal and cognitive-\\nbehavioral responses, the patient learns the fundamental processes with which they can manage their\\npanic symptoms (Craske & Barlow, 2014).\\nRelaxation training. Similar to that in exposure-based treatment for phobias, prior to engaging in\\nexposure training, the individual must learn relaxation techniques to apply during onset of panic\\nattacks. Though breathing training was once included as the relaxation training technique of choice for\\npanic disorder more recent research has failed to support this technique as effective in the use of panic\\ndisorder due to the high incidence of hyperventilation during panic attacks (Schmidt et al., 2000).\\nFindings suggest that breathing retraining is more commonly misused as a safety behavior or means for\\navoiding physical symptoms as opposed to an effective physiological response to stress (Craske &\\nBarlow, 2014).\\nProgressive muscle relaxation. To replace the breathing retraining, Craske & Barlow (2014) suggest\\nprogressive muscle relaxation (PMR). In PMR, the patient learns to tense and relax various large\\nmuscle groups throughout the body. The patient is encouraged to start at either the head or the feet,\\nand gradually work their way through the entire body, holding the tension for roughly 10 seconds\\nbefore relaxing. The theory behind PMR is that in tensing the muscles for a prolonged period, the\\nindividual exhausts those muscles, forcing them (and eventually) the entire body to engage in relaxation\\n(McCallie, Blum, & Hood, 2006).'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n171\\nCognitive restructuring. Cognitive restructuring, or the ability to recognize cognitive errors and\\nreplace them with alternate, more appropriate thoughts, is likely the most powerful part of CBT\\ntreatment for panic disorder, aside from the exposure part. As noted previously, cognitive restructuring\\ninvolves identifying the role of thoughts in generating and maintaining emotions. The clinician\\nencourages the patient to view these thoughts as “hypotheses” as opposed to fact, which allows the\\nbeliefs to be questioned and challenged. This is where the detailed recordings produced by self-\\nmonitoring are helpful. By discussing what the patient has recorded for the relationship between\\nphysiological arousal and thoughts/behaviors, the clinician can help the patient restructure the\\nmaladaptive thought processes to more positive thought processes, which in return, helps to reduce\\nfear and anxiety.\\nExposure. As discussed in detail in the specific phobia section, the patient is next encouraged to\\nengage in a variety of exposure techniques such as in vivo exposure and interoceptive exposure, while\\nalso incorporating the cognitive restructuring and relaxation techniques previously learned to reduce\\nand eliminate ongoing distress.  Interoceptive exposure involves inducing panic-specific symptoms to\\nthe individual repeatedly for a prolonged period, so that maladaptive thoughts about the sensations can\\nbe disconfirmed and conditional anxiety responses are extinguished (Craske & Barlow, 2014). Some\\nexamples of these exposure techniques include spinning a patient repeatedly in a chair to induce\\ndizziness and breathing in a paper bag to cause hyperventilation. These treatment approaches can be\\npresented gradually; however, the patient must endure the physiological sensations for at least 30\\nseconds to 1 minute to ensure adequate time for applying cognitive strategies to misappraisal of\\ncognitive symptoms (Craske & Barlow, 2014).\\nInteroceptive exposure is continued both in and outside of treatment until panic symptoms remit. Over\\ntime, the habituation of fear within an exposure session ultimately leads to habituation across treatment\\nand long-term remission of panic symptoms (Foa & McNally, 1996).  Occasionally, panic symptoms will\\nreturn in individuals who report complete remission of panic disorder. Follow-up booster sessions\\nreviewing the steps above are generally effective in eliminating symptoms again.\\n     7.5.5.2. Pharmacological interventions. According to Craske & Barlow (2014), nearly half of\\npatients with panic disorder present to psychotherapy already on medication, likely prescribed by their\\nprimary care physician. Some researchers argue that anti-anxiety medications impede the progress of\\nCBT treatment as the individual is not able to fully experience the physiological sensations during\\nexposure sessions, thus limiting their ability to modify maladaptive thoughts and maintaining the panic\\nsymptoms. Results from large clinical trials suggest no advantage during or immediately after treatment\\nof combining CBT and medication (Craske & Barlow, 2014). Additionally, when the medication was\\ndiscontinued post-treatment, the CBT+ medication groups fared worse than the CBT treatment-only\\ngroups, thus supporting the theory that immersion in interoceptive exposure is limited due to the use of\\nmedication. Therefore, it is suggested that medications be reserved for those who do not respond to\\nCBT therapy alone (Kampman, Keijers, Hoogduin & Hendriks, 2002).\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nTreatment options for generalized anxiety disorder include benzodiazepines, rational-emotive'),\n",

Furthermore, the somatic symptoms could take on many forms. For example, the individual\\nmay be faking the physical symptoms, imagining the symptoms, exaggerating the symptoms, or they\\ncould be real and triggered by external factors such as stress or other psychological disorders. The\\nsymptoms also may be part of a real medical illness or disorder, and therefore, the symptoms should be\\ntreated medicinally.\\nAll the disorders within this chapter share a common feature: there is a presence of somatic symptoms\\nand/or illness anxiety associated with significant distress or impairment. Oftentimes, individuals with a\\nsomatic disorder will present to their primary care physician with their physical complaints.\\nOccasionally, they will be referred to clinical psychologists after an extensive medical evaluation\\nconcludes that a medical diagnosis cannot explain their current symptoms. As you will see, despite their\\nsimilarities, there are key features that distinguish the disorders in this class from one another.\\n \\n8.1.1. Somatic Symptom Disorder\\nIndividuals with somatic symptom disorder often present with multiple somatic symptoms at one\\ntime. These symptoms are significant enough to impact their daily functioning, such as preventing them\\nfrom attending school, work, or family obligations. The symptoms can be localized (i.e., in one spot) or\\ndiffused (i.e., entire body), and can be specific or nonspecific (e.g., fatigue). Individuals with somatic\\nsymptom disorder often report excessive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors surrounding their somatic\\nsymptoms (APA, 2022). For example, individuals with somatic symptom disorder may spend an\\nexcessive amount of time or energy evaluating their symptoms, as well as the potential seriousness of\\ntheir symptoms. A lack of medical explanation is not needed for a diagnosis of somatic symptom\\ndisorder, as it is assumed that the individual’s suffering is authentic. Somatic symptom disorder is often\\ndiagnosed when another medical condition is present, as these two diagnoses are not mutually\\nexclusive.\\nSomatic symptom disorder patients generally present with significant worry about their illness. Their\\ninterpretation of symptoms is often viewed as threatening, harmful, or troublesome (APA, 2022).\\nBecause of their negative appraisals, they fear that their medical status is more serious than it typically\\nis, and high levels of distress are often reported. Oftentimes these patients will “shop” at different\\nphysician offices to confirm the seriousness of their symptoms.\\n \\n8.1.2. Illness Anxiety Disorder'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n175\\nIllness anxiety disorder, previously known as hypochondriasis, involves an excessive preoccupation\\nwith having or acquiring a serious medical illness. The key distinction between illness anxiety disorder\\nand somatic symptom disorder is that an individual with illness anxiety disorder does not typically\\npresent with any somatic symptoms. Occasionally an individual will present with a somatic symptom;\\nhowever, the intensity of the symptom is mild and does not drive the anxiety. Acquiring a serious illness\\ndrives concerns and they will even avoid visiting a sick relative or friend for fear of jeopardizing their\\nown health.\\nIndividuals with illness anxiety disorder generally are cleared medically; however, some individuals are\\ndiagnosed with a medical illness. In this case, their anxiety surrounding the severity of their disorder is\\nexcessive or disproportionate to their actual medical diagnosis. While an individual’s concern for an\\nillness may be due to a physical sign or sensation, most individual’s concerns are derived not from a\\nphysical complaint, but their actual anxiety related to a suspected medical disorder. This excessive\\nworry often expands to general anxiety regarding one’s health and disease. Unfortunately, this anxiety\\ndoes not decrease even after reassurance from a medical provider or negative test results, even when\\nprovided by multiple physicians and diagnostic tests.\\nAs one can imagine, the preoccupation and anxiety associated with attaining a medical illness severely\\nimpacts daily functioning. The individual will often spend copious amounts of time scanning and\\nanalyzing their body for “clues” of potential ailments. Additionally, an excessive amount of time is often\\nspent on internet searches related to symptoms and rare illnesses. Illness becomes a central feature of\\nthe person’s identity and self-image. Although extreme, some cases of invalidism have been reported\\ndue to illness anxiety disorder (APA, 2022).\\n \\nMaking Sense of the Disorders\\nIn relation to somatic symptom and related disorders, note the following:\\nFor somatic symptom disorder …… the patient presents with multiple somatic symptoms at one\\ntime that are significant enough to impact their daily functioning\\nFor illness anxiety disorder … the patient does not typically present with any somatic symptoms\\nbut if they do, the symptoms are just mild in intensity\\n \\n8.1.3. Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder (Conversion Disorder)\\nFunctional neurological symptom (conversion) disorder occurs when an individual presents with\\none or more symptoms of altered voluntary motor or sensory function (APA, 2022). Common motor\\nsymptoms include weakness or paralysis, abnormal movements (e.g., tremors), and gait abnormalities\\n(i.e., limping). Sensory symptoms include altered, reduced, or absent skin sensation, vision, or hearing.\\nLess commonly seen are epileptic seizures and episodes of unresponsiveness resembling fainting or\\ncoma (Marshall et al., 2013). The disorder was called “conversion disorder” in prior versions of the\\nDSM and in the psychiatric literature. As noted, “The term “conversion” originated in psychoanalytic\\ntheory, which proposes that unconscious psychic conflict is “converted” into physical symptoms” (APA,'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n176\\n2022).\\nThe most challenging aspect of functional neurological symptom disorder is the complex relationship\\nwith a medical evaluation. While a diagnosis of conversion disorder requires that the symptoms not be\\nexplained by a neurological disease, just because a medical provider fails to provide evidence that it is\\nnot a specific medical disorder is not sufficient. Therefore, there must be evidence of an incompatibility\\nof the medical disorder and the symptoms. For example, an individual experiencing a seizure would\\nrequire a normal simultaneous electroencephalogram (EEG), indicating that there is not epileptic\\nactivity during what was previously thought of as an epileptic seizure.\\n \\n8.1.4. Factitious Disorder\\nFactitious disorder differs from the three previously discussed somatic disorders in that there is\\ndeliberate falsification of medical or psychological symptoms imposed on oneself or on another, with the\\noverall intention of deception. While a medical condition may be present, the severity of impairment\\nrelated to the medical condition is more excessive due to the individual’s need to deceive those around\\nthem. Even more alarming is that this disorder is not only observed in the individual leading the\\ndeception— it can also be present in another individual, often a child or an individual with a\\ncompromised mental status who is not aware of the deception behind their illness.\\nSome examples of factitious disorder behaviors include, but are not limited to, altering a urine or blood\\ntest, falsifying medical records, ingesting a substance that would indicate abnormal laboratory results,\\nphysically injuring oneself, and inducing illness by injecting or ingesting a harmful substance. Although\\nmost individuals with factitious disorder seek treatment from health care professionals, some choose to\\nmislead community members either in person or online about the illness or injury (APA, 2022). While it\\nis unclear why an individual would want to fake their own (or someone else’s) physical illness, there is\\nsome evidence suggesting that factors such as depression, lack of parental support during childhood, or\\nan excessive need for social support may contribute to this disorder (McDermott, Leamon, Feldman, &\\nScott, 2012; Ozden & Canat, 1999; Feldman & Feldman, 1995).\\nIndividuals with factitious disorder are at risk for experiencing psychological distress or functional\\nimpairment causing harm to themselves and others such as family, friends, heath care professionals,\\nand faith leaders. The DSM-5-TR states, “Whereas some aspects of factitious disorders might represent\\ncriminal behavior, such criminal behavior and mental illness are not mutually exclusive” (APA, 2022, pg.\\n368).\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nSomatic symptom disorder is characterized by the presence of multiple somatic symptoms,\\nwhether localized or diffused and specific or nonspecific, at one time which impact daily\\nfunctioning.\\nIllness anxiety disorder is characterized by concern over having or acquiring a serious illness, and'),\n",

Epidemiology\\n \\nSection Learning Objectives\\nDescribe the epidemiology of somatic disorders.\\n \\nThe prevalence rates for somatic disorders are often difficult to determine; however, overall estimates\\nof somatic symptom disorder are around 4-6%. There is a trend that females report more somatic\\nsymptoms than males; thus, more females are diagnosed with somatic symptom disorder than males\\n(APA, 2022).\\nSeeing as illness anxiety disorder is a newer diagnosis (replacing hypochondriasis), prevalence rates\\nare largely based on the previous disorder. Previous findings suggest that illness anxiety disorder\\noccurs in 1.3% to 10% of the general population and is equal among males and females.\\nPrevalence rates of factitious disorder are largely unknown, likely due to the use of deception in\\nindividuals diagnosed with the disorder. Additionally, health care professionals infrequently record the\\ndiagnosis, even in recognized cases (APA, 2022).\\nAnd like the other somatic symptom disorders, the prevalence of functional neurological symptom\\ndisorder is unknown, even though transient functional neurological symptoms are common. In the\\nUnited States and northern Europe, research shows that the incidence of individual persistent\\nfunctional neurological symptoms to be around 4-12 of every 100,000 annually (APA, 2022).'),\n",

Comorbidity\\n \\nSection Learning Objectives\\nDescribe the comorbidity of somatic disorders.\\n \\nGiven that half of psychiatric patients also have an additional medical disorder, 35% have an\\nundiagnosed medical condition, and approximately 20% reported medical problems caused their mental\\ncondition, it should not come as a surprise that somatic disorders, in general, have high comorbidity\\nwith other psychological disorders (Felker, Yazel, & Short, 1996). More specifically, anxiety and\\ndepressive disorders are among the most commonly co-diagnosed disorders for somatic disorders.\\nWhile there is not a lot of information regarding specific comorbidities among somatic symptom and\\nrelated disorders, there is some evidence to suggest that those with illness anxiety disorder are at risk\\nof developing OCD and personality disorders. Similarly, personality disorders are more common in\\nindividuals with functional neurological symptom disorder than the general public. Somatic symptom\\ndisorder is also comorbid with PTSD and OCD.  (APA, 2022). No comorbidity information is given for\\nfactitious disorder.\\nThere is also high comorbidity between somatic disorders and other physical disorders classified as\\ncentral sensitivity syndromes (CSSs), due to their common central sensitization symptoms, yet\\nmedically unexplained symptoms (McGeary, Harzell, McGeary, & Gatchel, 2016). Disorders included in'),\n",

Etiology\\n \\nSection Learning Objectives\\nDescribe the psychodynamic causes of somatic disorders.\\nDescribe the cognitive causes of somatic disorders.\\nDescribe the behavioral causes of somatic disorders.\\nDescribe the sociocultural causes of somatic disorders.\\n \\n8.4.1. Psychodynamic\\nPsychodynamic theory suggests that somatic symptoms present as a response against unconscious\\nemotional issues. Two factors initiate and maintain somatic symptoms: primary gain and secondary\\ngain. Primary gains produce internal motivators, whereas secondary gains produce external motivators\\n(Jones, Carmel & Ball, 2008). When you relate this to somatic disorders, the primary gain, according to\\npsychodynamic theorists, provides protection from the anxiety or emotional symptoms and/or conflicts.\\nThis need for protection is expressed via a physical symptom such as pain, headache, etc. The\\nsecondary gain, the external experiences from the physical symptoms that maintain these physical'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n180\\nsymptoms, can range from attention and sympathy to missed work, obtaining financial assistance, or\\npsychiatric disability, to name a few.\\n \\n8.4.2. Cognitive\\nCognitive theorists often believe that somatic disorders are a result of negative beliefs or exaggerated\\nfears of physiological sensations. Individuals with somatic related disorders may have a heightened\\nsensitivity to bodily sensations. This sensitivity, combined with their maladaptive thought patterns, may\\nlead individuals to overanalyze and interpret their physiological symptoms in a negative light.\\nFor example, an individual with a headache may catastrophize the symptoms and believe that their\\nheadache is the direct result of a brain tumor, as opposed to stress or other inoculate reasons. When\\ntheir medical provider does not confirm this diagnosis, the individual may then catastrophize even\\nfurther, believing they have an extremely rare disorder that requires an evaluation from a specialist.\\n \\n8.4.3. Behavioral\\nKeeping true with the behavioral approach to psychological disorders, behaviorists propose that\\nsomatic disorders are developed and maintained by reinforcers. More specifically, individuals\\nexperiencing significant somatic symptoms are often rewarded by gaining attention from other people\\n(Witthoft & Hiller, 2010). These rewards may also extend to more significant factors, such as receiving\\ndisability payments.\\nWhile the behavioral theory of somatic disorders appears to be like the psychodynamic theory of\\nsecondary gains, there is a clear distinction between the two – behaviorists view these gains as the\\nprimary reason for the development and maintenance of the disorder, whereas psychodynamic theorists\\nview these gains as secondary, only after the underlying conflicts create the disorder.\\n \\n8.4.4. Sociocultural\\nThere are a couple of different ways that sociocultural factors contribute to somatic related disorders.\\nFirst, there is the social factor of familial influence that likely plays a significant role in the attention to\\nsomatic symptoms. Individuals with somatic symptom disorder are more likely to have a family member\\nor close friend who is overly attentive to their somatic symptoms or report high anxiety related to their\\nhealth (Watt, O’Connor, Stewart, Moon, & Terry, 2008; Schulte, Petermann, & Noeker, 2010).\\nCulturally, Western countries express less of a focus on somatic complaints compared to those in the\\nEastern part of the world. This may be explained by the different evaluations of the relationship\\nbetween mind and body. For example, Westerners tend to have a view that psychological symptoms\\nsometimes influence somatic symptoms, whereas Easterners focus more heavily on the mind-body\\nrelationship and how psychological and somatic symptoms interact with one another.  These different\\ncultural beliefs are routinely seen in research where Asian populations are more likely to report the\\nphysical symptoms related to stress than the cognitive or emotional problems that many in the United'),\n",

Treatment\\n \\nSection Learning Objectives\\nDescribe treatment options for somatic disorders.\\n \\nTreatment for these disorders is often difficult as individuals see their problems as completely medical,\\nand therefore, do not think psychological intervention is necessary (Lahmann, Henningsen, & Noll-\\nHussong, 2010). Once an individual does not find relief from their symptoms after meeting with several\\ndifferent physicians, they often do willingly engage in psychotherapy, psychopharmacology, or both (Raj\\net al., 2014).\\nAmong the most effective treatment approaches is the biopsychosocial model of treatment. This\\napproach considers the various biological, psychological, and social factors that influence the illness\\nand presenting symptoms (Gatchel et al., 2007).  This treatment is often achieved through a\\nmultidisciplinary approach where the symptoms are managed by many providers, usually including a'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n182\\nphysician, psychiatrist, and psychologist. The interdisciplinary approach involves a higher level of care\\nas the multiple disciplines interact with one another and identify a treatment goal (Gatchel et al., 2007).\\nThis approach, although more difficult to find, particularly in more rural settings, is presumed to be\\nmore effective due to the integration of health care providers and their ability to work together to treat\\nthe patient uniformly.\\n \\n8.5.1. Psychotherapy\\n      8.5.1.1. Psychodynamic. Interpersonal psychotherapy, a type of psychodynamic therapy, has been\\nfound to be efficacious in treating somatic disorders. Interpersonal psychotherapy focuses on the\\nrelationship between self-experience and the unconscious, and how these factors contribute to body\\ndysfunction. This type of treatment has been shown to reduce anxiety, depression, and improve the\\noverall quality of life immediately following treatment; however, effects appear to diminish over time\\n(Abass et al., 2014; Steinert et al., 2015).\\n      8.5.1.2. CBT. Traditional cognitive-behavioral therapies (CBT) have been employed to address the\\ncognitive attributions and maladaptive coping strategies that are responsible for the development and\\nmaintenance of the disorder. The most common misattribution for these disorders is catastrophic\\nthinking, or the rumination about worst-case scenario outcomes. Additionally, goals of CBT treatment\\nare the acceptance of the medical condition, addressing avoidance behaviors, and mediating\\nexpectations of treatment (Gatchel et al., 2014).\\n      8.5.1.3. Behavioral. Behavioral therapies have also been shown to effectively manage complex\\nchronic somatic symptoms, particularly pain.

Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions\\n \\nSection Learning Objectives\\nDescribe how psychological factors affecting other medical conditions presents.\\nList and describe the most common types of psychophysiological disorders.\\nDescribe treatment options for psychological factors affecting other medical conditions.\\n \\nAlthough previously known as psychosomatic disorders, the DSM-5-TR has identified physical illnesses\\nthat are caused or exacerbated by biopsychosocial factors as psychological factors affecting other\\nmedical conditions. This disorder is different than all the previously mentioned somatic related\\ndisorders as the primary focus of the disorder is not the mental disorder, but rather the physical\\ndisorder. Psychological or behavioral factors adversely affect the medical condition by, “…influencing\\nits course or treatment, by constituting an additional well-established health risk factor, or by\\ninfluencing the underlying pathophysiology to precipitate or exacerbate symptoms or to necessitate\\nmedical attention” (APA, 2022, pg. 365). It is believed that a lack of positive coping strategies,\\npsychological distress, or maladaptive health behaviors exacerbate these physical symptoms (McGeary,\\nHarzell, McGeary, & Gatchel, 2016).\\n \\n8.6.1. Psychophysiological Disorders\\nThe most common types of psychophysiological disorders are headaches (migraines and tension),'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n184\\ngastrointestinal (ulcer and irritable bowel), insomnia, and cardiovascular-related disorders (coronary\\nheart disease and hypertension). We will briefly review these disorders and discuss the associated\\npsychological features believed to exacerbate symptoms.\\n      8.6.1.1. Headaches. Among the most common types of headaches are migraines and tension\\nheadaches (Williamson, 1981). Migraine headaches are often more severe and are explained by a\\nthrobbing pain localized to one side of the head, frequently accompanied by nausea, vomiting,\\nsensitivity to light, and vertigo. It is believed that migraines are caused by the blood vessels in the brain\\nnarrowing, thus reducing the blood flow to various parts of the brain, followed by the same vessels later\\nexpanding, thus rapidly changing the blood flow. It is estimated that 23 million people in the U.S. alone\\nsuffer from migraines (Williamson, Barker, Veron-Guidry, 1994).\\nTension headaches are often described as a dull, constant ache localized to one part of the head or\\nneck; however, it can co-occur in multiple places at one time. Unlike migraines, nausea, vomiting, and\\nsensitivity to light do not often occur with tension headaches. Tension headaches, as well as migraines,\\nare believed to be primarily caused by stress as they are in response to sustained muscle contraction\\nthat is often exhibited by those under extreme stress or emotion (Williamson, Barker, Veron-Guidry,\\n1994).  In efforts to reduce the frequency and intensity of both migraines and tension headaches,\\nindividuals have found relief in relaxation techniques, as well as the use of biofeedback training to help\\nencourage the relaxation of muscles.\\n      8.6.1.2. Gastrointestinal. Among the two most common types of gastrointestinal\\npsychophysiological disorders are ulcers and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Ulcers, or painful\\nsores in the stomach lining, occur when mucus from digestive juices are reduced, allowing digestive\\nacids to burn a hole into the stomach lining. Among the most common type of ulcers are peptic ulcers,\\nwhich are caused by the bacteria H. pylori (Sung, Kuipers, El-Serag, 2009). While there is evidence to\\nsupport the involvement of stress in the development of dyspeptic symptoms, the evidence linking\\nstress and peptic ulcers is slowly growing. (Purdy, 2013). Researchers believe that while H. pylori must\\nbe present for a peptic ulcer to develop, increased stress levels may impact the amount of digestive acid\\npresent in the stomach lining, thus increasing the frequency and intensity of symptoms (Sung, Kuipers,\\nEl-Serag, 2009).\\nIBS is a chronic, functional disorder of the gastrointestinal tract. Common symptoms of IBS include\\nabdominal pain and extreme bowel habits (diarrhea or constipation). It affects up to a quarter of the\\npopulation and is responsible for nearly half of all referrals to gastroenterologists (Sandler, 1990).\\nBecause IBS is a functional disorder, there are no known structural, chemical, or physiological\\nabnormalities responsible for the symptoms. However, there is conclusive evidence that IBS symptoms\\nare related to psychological distress, particularly in those with anxiety or depression. Although more\\nresearch is needed to pinpoint the timing between the onset of IBS and psychological disorders,\\npreliminary evidence suggests that psychological distress is present before IBS symptoms. Therefore,\\nIBS may be best explained as a somatic expression of associated psychological problems (Sykes,\\nBlanchard, Lackner, Keefer, & Krasner, 2003).\\n      8.6.1.3. Insomnia. Insomnia, the difficulty falling or staying asleep, occurs in more than one-third\\nof the U.S. population, with approximately 10% of patients reporting chronic insomnia (Perlis &\\nGehrman, 2013). While exact pathways of chronic psychophysiological insomnia are unclear, there is\\nevidence of some biopsychosocial factors that may predispose an individual to develop insomnia such as'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n185\\nanxiety, depression, and overactive arousal systems (Trauer et al., 2015). Part of the difficulty with\\ninsomnia is the fact that these psychological symptoms can impact one’s ability to fall asleep; however,\\nwe also know that lack of adequate sleep also predisposes individuals to increased psychological\\ndistress. Due to this cyclic nature of psychological distress and insomnia, intervention for both sleep\\nissues as well as psychological issues is vital to managing symptoms.\\n      8.6.1.4. Cardiovascular. Heart disease has been the leading cause of death in the United States\\nfor the past several decades. Costs related to disability, medical procedures, and societal burdens are\\nestimated to be $444 billion a year (Purdy, 2013). With this large financial burden, there have been\\nconsiderable efforts to identify risk and protective factors in predicting cardiovascular mortality.\\nResearchers have identified that depression is a predictor of early-onset coronary heart disease\\n(Ketterer, Knysk, Khanal, & Hudson, 2006). More specifically, there is a five-fold increase of depression\\nin those with coronary heart disease than the general population (Ketterer, Knysk, Khanal, & Hudson,\\n2006). Additionally, anxiety and anger have also been identified as an early predictor of cardiac events,\\nsuggesting psychological interventions aimed at reducing anxiety and establishing positive coping\\nstrategies for anger management may be effective in reducing future cardiac events (Ketterer, Knysk,\\nKhanal, & Hudson, 2006).\\n      8.6.1.5. Hypertension. Also called or chronically elevated blood pressure, is also found to be\\naffected by psychological factors. More specifically, constant stress, anxiety, and depression have all\\nbeen found to impact the likelihood of a cardiac event due to their impact on vasoconstriction (Purdy,\\n2013). Elevated inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein, which is indicative of plaque\\ninstability, has been found in chronically depressed individuals, thus predisposing them to potential\\nheart attacks (Ketterer, Knysk, Khanal, & Hudson, 2006).\\n \\n8.6.2. Treatments for Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions\\nAs more information regarding contributing factors to psychophysiological disorders is discovered,\\nmore psychological treatment approaches have been developed and applied to these medical problems.\\nThe most common types of treatments include relaxation training, biofeedback, hypnosis, traditional\\nCBT treatments, group therapy, as well as a combination of the previous treatments.\\n      8.6.2.1. Relaxation training. Relaxation training essentially teaches individuals how to relax their\\nmuscles on command. While relaxation is used in combination with other psychological interventions to\\nreduce anxiety (as seen in PTSD and various anxiety disorders), it has also been shown to be effective in\\ntreating physical symptoms such as headaches, chronic pain, as well as pain related to specific causes\\n(e.g., injection sites, side effects of medications; McKenna et al., 2015).\\n      8.6.2.2. Biofeedback. Biofeedback is a unique psychological treatment in which an individual is\\nconnected to a machine (usually a computer) that allows for continuous monitoring of involuntary\\nphysiological reactions. Measurements that can be obtained are heart rate, galvanic skin response,\\nrespiration, muscle tension, and body temperature, to name a few.\\nThere are a few different ways in which biofeedback can be administered. The first is clinician-led. The\\nclinician will actively guide the patient through a relaxation monologue, encouraging the patient to\\nrelax muscles associated near the pain region (or within the entire body). While going through the'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n186\\nmonologue, the clinician is provided with real-time feedback about the patient’s physiological response.\\nResearch studies have routinely supported the use of biofeedback, particularly for those with pain and\\nheadaches that have not been responsive to pharmacological interventions (McKenna et al., 2015).\\nAnother option of biofeedback is through computer programs developed by psychologists. The most\\ncommon, a program called Wild Devine (now Unyte) is an integrative relaxation program that\\nencourages the use of breathing techniques while simultaneously measuring the patient’s physiological\\nresponses. This type of programming is especially helpful for younger patients as there are various\\n“games” the child can play that requires the awareness and control of their thoughts, feelings, and\\nemotions.\\n      8.6.2.3. Hypnosis. Hypnosis, which some argue is just an extreme sense of relaxation, has been\\neffective in reducing pain and managing anxiety symptoms associated with medical procedures (Lang et\\nal., 2000). Through extensive training, an individual can learn to engage in self-hypnosis or obtain\\nrecorded hypnosis monologues to assist with the management of physiological symptoms outside of\\nhypnosis sessions. While additional research is still needed within the field of hypnosis, studies have\\nindicated that hypnosis is effective in not only treating chronic pain, but also assists with a reduction in\\nanxiety, improved sleep, and improved overall quality of life (Jensen et al., 2006).\\n      8.6.2.4. Group Therapy. Group therapy is another effective treatment option for individuals with\\npsychological distress related to physical disorders. These groups not only aim to reduce the negative\\nemotions associated with chronic illnesses, but they also provide support from other group members\\nthat are experiencing the same physical and psychological symptoms. These groups are typically CBT\\nbased and utilize cognitive and behavioral strategies in a group setting to encourage acceptance of\\ndisease while also addressing maladaptive coping strategies.\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nPsychological factors affecting other medical conditions has as its primary focus the physical\\ndisorder, and not the mental disorder.\\nThe most common types of psychophysiological disorders include headaches to include migraines\\nand tension, gastrointestinal to include ulcers and IBS, insomnia, coronary heart disease, and\\nhypertension.\\nCommon treatments for these other medical conditions include relaxation training, biofeedback,\\nhypnosis, traditional CBT treatments, and group therapy.\\n \\nSection 8.6 Review Questions\\nWhat are the most common types of psychophysiological disorders?1.\\nDiscuss the differences between the different types of headaches.2.\\nWhat is the difference between ulcers and irritable bowel syndrome?3.\\nWhat are the identified predictors to coronary heart disease and other cardiac events?4.'),\n",

Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder\\nObsessive-compulsive disorder, more commonly known as OCD, requires the presence of obsessions,\\ncompulsions, or both. Obsessions are defined as repetitive and persistent thoughts, urges, or images.\\nThese obsessions are intrusive, time-consuming (i.e., take more than an hour a day), and unwanted,\\noften causing significant distress or impairment in an individual’s daily functioning. Common obsessions\\nare contamination (dirt on self or objects), errors of uncertainty regarding daily behaviors (locking the\\ndoor, turning off appliances), thoughts of physical harm or violence, and orderliness, to name a few\\n(Cisler, Adams, et al., 2011; Yadin & Foa, 2009). Often the individual will try to ignore these thoughts,\\nurges, or images. When they are unable to ignore them, the individual will engage in compulsory\\nbehaviors to gain temporary relief from the distress or anxiety.\\nCompulsions are time-consuming, repetitive behaviors or mental acts that an individual performs in\\nresponse to an obsession. Common examples of compulsions are checking (e.g., repeatedly checking if\\nthe stove is turned off even though the first four-times they checked it was), counting (e.g., flicking the\\nlights off and on exactly five times), hand washing, symmetry, fears of harm to self or others, or\\nrepeating specific words (APA, 2022). These compulsive behaviors essentially alleviate the anxiety\\nassociated with the obsessive thoughts. For example, an individual may feel as though their hands are\\ndirty after using utensils at a restaurant. They may obsess over this thought for some time, impacting\\ntheir ability to interact with others or complete a specific task. This obsession will ultimately lead to the\\nindividual performing a compulsion where they will wash their hands with extremely hot water to rid all\\nthe germs, or even wash their hands a specified number of times if they also have a counting\\ncompulsion. At this point, the individual’s anxiety should be temporarily relieved.\\nThese obsessions and compulsions are more excessive than the typical “cleanliness” as they consume a\\nlarge part of the individual’s day. Additionally, they cause significant impairment in one’s daily\\nfunctioning. Given the example above, an individual with a fear of contamination may refuse to eat at\\nrestaurants, or they may bring their utensils from home. The frequency and severity of the obsessions\\nand compulsions varies by patient, with some having mild to moderate symptoms and only spending 1-3\\nhours a day obsessing or engaging in compulsive behaviors, while other patients present with severe\\nsymptoms and have nearly constant intrusive thoughts or compulsions that can become incapacitating\\n(APA, 2022).\\n \\n9.1.2. Body Dysmorphic Disorder\\nBody dysmorphic disorder is another obsessive disorder; however, the focus of the obsessions is with\\nperceived defects or flaws in one’s physical appearance. A key feature of these obsessions is that they\\nare not observable or appear slight to others. An individual who has a congenital facial defect or a burn\\nvictim who is concerned about their scars are not examples of an individual with body dysmorphic\\ndisorder. The obsessions related to one’s appearance can run the spectrum from feeling “unattractive”\\nto “looking hideous.” While any part of the body can be a concern for an individual with body\\ndysmorphic disorder, the most commonly reported areas are skin (acne, wrinkles, skin color), hair\\n(particularly thinning or excessive body hair), and nose (size or shape; APA, 2022). Interestingly, the'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n190\\ndisorder can occur by proxy meaning the individual is not concerned with their own defects but those of\\nanother person, often a spouse or partner but at times, a parent, child, sibling, or stranger.\\nDue to the distressing nature of the obsessions regarding one’s body, individuals with body dysmorphic\\ndisorder also engage in compulsive behaviors that take up a considerable amount of time in their day.\\nFor example, they may repeatedly compare their body to other people’s bodies in the general public;\\nfrequently look at themselves in the mirror; engage in excessive grooming, which includes using make-\\nup to modify their appearance. Some individuals with body dysmorphic disorder will go as far as having\\nnumerous plastic surgeries in attempts to obtain their “perfect” appearance.\\nWhile most of us are guilty of engaging in some of these behaviors, to meet criteria for body dysmorphic\\ndisorder, one must spend a considerable amount of time preoccupied with their appearance (i.e., on\\naverage 3-8 hours a day), as well as display significant impairment in social, occupational, or other\\nareas of functioning. Some individuals excessively tan, change their clothes repeatedly, or compulsively\\nshop such as for beauty products. Camouflaging perceived defects is a common behavior and could\\ninvolve applying makeup, adjusting a hat or one’s clothes, or covering the forehead or eyes with one’s\\nhair, all to hide or cover the perceived defect or problem area (APA, 2022).\\nAs the DSM-5-TR notes, body dysmorphic disorder has been associated with, “abnormalities in emotion\\nrecognition, attention, and executive function, as well as information-processing biases and\\ninaccuracies in interpretation of information and social situations” (APA, 2022, pg. 273). These\\nindividuals tend to express a bias for negative and threatening interpretations of facial expressions and\\nsituations that would be classified as ambiguous, for instance.\\n     9.1.2.1. Muscle dysmorphia. While muscle dysmorphia is not a formal diagnosis, it is a common\\ntype of BDD, particularly within the male population. Muscle dysmorphia refers to the belief that one’s\\nbody is too small or lacks the appropriate amount of muscle definition (Ahmed, Cook, Genen &\\nSchwartz, 2014). While the severity of BDD between individuals with and without muscle dysmorphia\\nappears to be the same, some studies have found higher use of substance abuse (i.e., steroid use),\\npoorer quality of life, and increased reports of suicide attempts in those with muscle dysmorphia (Pope,\\nPope, Menard, Fay Olivardia, & Philips, 2005). The DSM-5-TR instructs clinicians to specify if body\\ndysmorphic disorder occurs with muscle dysmorphia.\\n     9.1.2.2. Insight specifiers. Those diagnosed with body dysmorphic disorder vary in the degree of\\ninsight they have about the accuracy of their body dysmorphic disorder beliefs, ranging from good to\\nabsent/delusional. On average, insight is poor and at least one-third of those diagnosed with the\\ndisorder display absent/delusional insight. Mental health professionals would indicate the degree of\\ninsight regarding body dysmorphic disorder beliefs using with good or fair insight, with poor insight, or\\nwith absent insight/delusional beliefs. See page 272 of the DSM-5-TR for more information. Note that\\nthe insight specifier is used with OCD and hoarding disorders as well.\\n \\n9.1.3. Hoarding Disorder\\nIn hoarding disorder, the key feature is the persistent over-accumulation of possessions (APA, 2022).\\nWhile we all obtain items throughout life, individuals with hoarding disorder continue to accumulate\\nitems without discarding possessions, regardless of their value or sentiment. This lack of discarding\\noccurs over a long period and is not explained by a recent significant stressor (e.g., lost house in fire, so'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n191\\nnow keeps everything). For example, last week’s newspaper would likely have no relevance to you or\\npossibly any historical value, but those with hoarding disorder would keep this newspaper despite the\\nlack of value or sentiment.\\nThe most commonly hoarded items are newspapers, magazines, clothes, bags, books, mail, and\\npaperwork (APA, 2022). While these items may be stored in attics and garages, individuals with a\\nhoarding disorder also have these items cluttering their living space, sometimes to the extent that they\\nare unable to utilize their furniture because it is covered in stuff. Cognitive factors contributing to the\\nneed to hold onto these non-sentimental items are fear of losing valuable information and fear of being\\nwasteful. When asked to “clean out” their house or get rid of these items, individuals with hoarding\\ndisorder experience significant distress. Individuals with hoarding disorder display indecisiveness,\\navoidance, procrastination, perfectionism, difficulty planning and organizing tasks, and are easily\\ndistractible.\\nOne’s hoarding behaviors also impacts their daily functioning and causes impairment in social and\\noccupational functioning. It can lead to low quality of life and in extreme cases, place the individual at\\nrisk for figure, falling, poor sanitation, and other health risks. Family relationships are often strained\\nand conflict with neighbors and local authorities is common (APA, 2022).\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nAs part of OCD, obsessions are repetitive and persistent thoughts, urges, or images while\\ncompulsions are repetitive behaviors or mental acts that an individual performs in response to an\\nobsession.\\nBody dysmorphic disorder is characterized by obsessions over perceived defects or flaws in one’s\\nphysical appearance.\\nMuscle dysmorphia refers to the belief that one’s body is too small or lacks the appropriate\\namount of muscle definition and is a type of body dysmorphic disorder common to men.\\nHoarding disorder is characterized by accumulating items without discarding possessions,\\nregardless of their value or sentiment.\\n \\nSection 9.1 Review Questions\\nDefine obsessions and compulsions.

OCD\\nThe prevalence rate for OCD is approximately 1.2% both in the U.S. and worldwide (APA, 2022). Women\\nare diagnosed with OCD more often than males; however, in childhood, boys are diagnosed more\\nfrequently than girls (APA, 2022). With respect to gender and symptoms, females are more likely to be\\ndiagnosed with cleaning related obsessions and compulsions. In contrast, males are more likely to\\ndisplay symptoms related to forbidden thoughts and symmetry (APA, 2022). The DSM-5-TR reports that\\nthe mean age of onset of OCD is 19.5 years with a quarter of cases starting by 14 years of age.\\nAdditionally, males have an earlier age of onset (5-15 yrs.) compared to females (20-24 yrs.; Rasmussen\\n& Eisen, 1990).\\n \\n9.2.2. Body Dysmorphic Disorder\\nThe point prevalence rate for body dysmorphic disorder among U.S. adults is 2.4% while outside the\\nU.S., the point prevalence is 1.7% to 2.9%. Gender-based prevalence rates indicate that women are\\nmore likely to be diagnosed with body dysmorphic disorder than men, though muscle dysmorphia is\\ndiagnosed more frequently in men. Additionally, women are more likely to be preoccupied with weight,\\nbreasts, buttocks, legs, hips, and excessive body or facial hair while men have preoccupations with their\\ngenitals, body build, and thinning hair (APA, 2022).\\n \\n9.2.3. Hoarding Disorder\\nWhile national studies on the prevalence rate of hoarding within the U.S. and internationally are not\\navailable, community surveys estimate clinically significant hoarding as occurring in 1.5% to 6.0% of\\nthe population (APA, 2022; Gilliam & Tolin, 2010).

Nearly 76% of individuals with\\nOCD will be diagnosed with another anxiety disorder, most commonly panic disorder, social anxiety\\ndisorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or a specific phobia. Additionally, due to the nature of OCD and\\nits symptoms, nearly 41% of those with OCD will also be diagnosed with a depressive or bipolar\\ndisorder (APA, 2022).\\nThere is a high comorbidity between OCD and tic disorder, particularly in males with an onset of OCD\\nin childhood. Children presenting with early-onset OCD typically have a different presentation of\\nsymptoms than traditional OCD. Research has also indicated a strong triad of OCD, tic disorder, and\\nADHD in children.

Therefore,\\nclinicians who have a patient diagnosed with one of the disorders should also routinely assess patients\\nfor OCD (APA, 2022).\\nFinally, OCD has a mean rate of lifetime suicide attempts of 14.2%, a mean rate of lifetime suicidal\\nideation of 44.1%, and a mean rate of current suicidal ideation of 25.9%. Severity of OCD, the symptom\\ndimension of unacceptable thoughts, a history of suicidality, and severity of comorbid depressive and\\nanxiety symptoms are predictors of greater suicide risk (APA, 2022).\\n \\n9.3.2.

Additionally, first degree\\nrelatives of patients diagnosed with OCD are at a 5-fold increase to develop OCD at some point\\nthroughout their lifespan (Nestadt, et al., 2000).\\nInterestingly, a study conducted by Nestadt and colleagues (2000) exploring the familial role in the\\ndevelopment of obsessive-compulsive disorder found that family members of individuals with OCD had\\nhigher rates of both obsessions and compulsions than control families; however, the familial\\nrelationship with regards to obsessions were stronger than that of compulsions suggesting that there is\\na stronger heritability association for obsessions than compulsions.\\nThis study also found a relationship between age of onset of OCD symptoms and family heritability.\\nIndividuals who experienced an earlier age of onset, particularly before age 17, were found to have\\nmore first-degree relatives diagnosed with OCD. In fact, after the age of 17, there was no relationship\\nbetween family diagnoses, suggesting those who develop OCD at an older age may have a different\\ndiagnostic origin (Nestadt, et al., 2000).\\nInitial studies exploring genetic factors for BDD and hoarding also indicate a hereditary influence;\\nhowever, environmental factors appear to play a more significant role in the development of these\\ndisorders than that of OCD (Ahmed, et al., 2014; Lervolino et al., 2009).\\n     9.4.1.2. Neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters, particularly serotonin, have been identified as a\\ncontributing factor to obsessive and compulsive behaviors. This discovery was made accidentally, when\\nindividuals with depression and comorbid OCD were given antidepressant medications clomipramine'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n196\\nand fluoxetine—both of which increase levels of serotonin—to mediate symptoms of depression. Not\\nonly did these patients report a significant reduction in their depressive symptoms, but also a\\nsubstantial improvement in their OCD symptoms (Bokor & Anderson, 2014). Antidepressant\\nmedications that do not affect serotonin levels are not effective in managing obsessive and compulsive\\nsymptoms, thus offering additional support for deficits of serotonin levels as an explanation of obsessive\\nand compulsive behaviors (Sinopoli, Burton, Kronenberg, & Arnold, 2017; Bokor & Anderson, 2014).\\nMore recently, there has been some research implicating the involvement of additional\\nneurotransmitters—glutamate, GABA, and dopamine—in the development and maintenance of OCD,\\nalthough future studies are still needed to draw definitive conclusions (Marinova, Chuang, & Fineberg,\\n2017).\\n     9.4.1.3. Brain structures. Seeing as neurotransmitters have direct involvement in the\\ndevelopment of obsessive-compulsive behaviors, it’s only logical that brain structures that house these\\nneurotransmitters also likely play a role in symptom development. Neuroimaging studies implicate the\\nbrain structures and circuits in the frontal lobe, more specifically, the orbitofrontal cortex, which is\\nlocated just above each eye (Marsh et al., 2014). This brain region is responsible for mediating strong\\nemotional responses and converts them into behavioral responses. Once the orbitofrontal cortex\\nreceives sensory/emotional information via sensory inputs, it transmits this information through\\nimpulses. These impulses are then passed on to the caudate nuclei, which filters through the many\\nimpulses received, passing along only the strongest impulses to the thalamus. Once the impulses reach\\nthe thalamus, the individual essentially reassesses the emotional response and decides whether to act\\n(Beucke et al., 2013). It is believed that individuals with obsessive compulsive behaviors experience\\noveractivity of the orbitofrontal cortex and a lack of filtering in the caudate nuclei, thus causing too\\nmany impulses to transfer to the thalamus (Endrass et al., 2011). Further support for this theory has\\nbeen shown when individuals with OCD experience brain damage to the orbitofrontal cortex or caudate\\nnuclei and experience remission of OCD symptoms (Hofer et al., 2013).\\n \\n9.4.2. Cognitive\\nCognitive theorists believe that OCD behaviors occur due to an individual’s distorted thinking and\\nnegative cognitive biases. More specifically, individuals with OCD are more likely to overestimate the\\nprobability of harm, loss of control, or uncertainty in their life, thus leading them to over-interpret\\npotential negative outcomes of events. Additionally, some research has indicated that those with OCD\\nalso experience disconfirmation bias, which causes the individual to seek out evidence of their failure to\\nperform the ritual or compensatory behavior correctly (Sue, Sue, Sue, & Sue, 2017). Finally, individuals\\nwith OCD often report the inability to trust themselves and their instincts, and therefore, feel the need\\nto repeat the compulsive behavior multiple times to ensure it is done correctly. These cognitive biases\\nare supported throughout research studies that repeatedly find individuals with OCD experience more\\nintrusive thoughts than those without OCD (Jacob, Larson, & Storch, 2014).\\nWe have shown that individuals with OCD experience cognitive biases and that these biases contribute\\nto the obsessive and compulsive behaviors, but why do these cognitive biases occur so often? Everyone\\nhas times when they have repetitive or intrusive thoughts such as: “Did I shut the oven off after cooking\\ndinner?” or “Did I remember to lock the door before I left home?” Fortunately, most individuals are able\\nto either concede to their thoughts once, or even forgo acknowledging their thoughts after they\\nconfidently talk themselves through their actions, ensuring that the behavior in question was or was not'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n197\\ncompleted. Unfortunately, individuals with OCD are unable to neutralize these thoughts without\\nperforming a ritual as a way to put themselves at ease. As you will see in more detail in the behavioral\\nsection below, the behaviors (compulsions) used to neutralize the thoughts (obsessions) provide\\ntemporary relief to the individual. As the individual is continually exposed to the obsession and\\nrepeatedly engages in the compulsive behaviors to neutralize their anxiety, the behavior is repeatedly\\nreinforced, thus becoming a compulsion. This theory is supported by studies where individuals with\\nOCD report using more neutralizing strategies and report significant reductions in anxiety after\\nemploying these neutralizing techniques (Jacob, Larson, & Storch, 2014; Salkovskis et al., 2003).\\n \\n9.4.3. Behavioral\\nThe behavioral explanation of obsessive compulsive-related disorders focuses on compulsions rather\\nthan obsessions. Behaviorists believe that these compulsions begin with and are maintained through\\noperant conditioning. How so? Well, an individual with OCD may experience negative thoughts or\\nanxieties related to an unpleasant event (obsession; the event is a stimulus). These thoughts/anxieties\\ncause significant distress to the individual, and therefore, they seek out some behavior (compulsion; the\\nresponse) to alleviate these threats (i.e., escape behavior associated with negative reinforcement). This\\nprovides temporary relief to the individual, thus reinforcing the compulsive behaviors used to lessen the\\nthreat. Over time, the compulsive behaviors are reinforced due to the repeated exposure of the\\nobsession and the temporary relief that comes with engaging in these compulsive behaviors (escape\\nbehavior).\\nStrong support for this theory is the fact that the behavioral treatment option for OCD- exposure and\\nresponse prevention, is among the most effective treatments for these disorders. As you will read below,\\nthis treatment essentially breaks the patient’s operant conditioning associated with the obsessions and\\ncompulsions by preventing the individual from engaging in the compulsive behavior until anxiety is\\nreduced.\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nBiological causes of obsessive-compulsive disorders include hereditary transmission,\\nneurotransmitter deficits particularly in relation to serotonin, and abnormal functioning in brain\\nstructures.\\nCognitive causes of obsessive-compulsive disorders include distorted thinking such as\\noverestimating the probability of harm, loss of control, or uncertainty in their life, and negative\\ncognitive biases such as disconfirmation bias.\\nBehavioral causes of obsessive-compulsive disorders include operant conditioning.\\n \\nSection 9.4 Review Questions'),\n",

OCD\\n     9.5.1.1. Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP). Treatment of OCD has come a long way in\\nrecent years. Among the most effective treatment options is exposure and response prevention (March,\\nFrances, Kahn, & Carpenter, 1997). First developed by psychiatrist Victor Meyer (1966), as you might\\ninfer from the name, individuals are repeatedly exposed to their obsession, thus causing anxiety/fears,\\nwhile simultaneously prevented from engaging in their compulsive behaviors. Exposure sessions are\\noften done in vivo (in real life), via videos, or even imaginary, depending on the type of obsession. For\\nexample, a fear that one’s house would burn down if their compulsion was not carried out would\\nobviously be done via imaginary exposure, as it would not be ethical to have a person burn their house\\ndown.\\nPrior to beginning the exposure and response prevention exercises, the clinician must teach the patient\\nrelaxation techniques for them to engage in during the distress of being exposed to the obsession. Once\\nrelaxation techniques are taught, the clinician and patient will develop a hierarchy of obsessions.\\nTreatment will start at those with the lowest amount of distress to ensure the patient has success with\\ntreatment, as well as preventing withdrawal of treatment.\\nWithin the hierarchy of obsessions, the individual is also gradually exposed to their obsession. For\\nexample, an individual obsessed with germs, may first watch a person sneeze on the computer in\\nsession. Once anxiety is managed and compulsions refrain at this level of exposure, the individual would\\nmove on to being present in the same room as a sick individual, to eventually shaking hands with'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n199\\nsomeone obviously sick, each time preventing them from engaging in their compulsive behavior. Once\\nthis level of their hierarchy was managed, they would move on to the next obsession and so forth until\\nthe entire list was complete.\\nTreatment outcome for exposure and response prevention is very effective in treating individuals with\\nOCD. In fact, some studies suggest up to an 86% response rate when treatment is completed (Foa et al.,\\n2005). Combination treatments such as ERP with family counseling (utilizing CBT techniques) may\\nincrease this response rate even higher (Bolleau, 2011; Krebs & Heyman, 2015). Like most OCD related\\ntreatments, the largest barrier to treatment is getting patients to commit to treatment, as the repeated\\nexposures and prevention of compulsive behaviors can be extremely distressing to patients.\\n     9.5.1.2. Psychopharmacology. There has been minimal support for the treatment of OCD with\\nmedication alone. This is likely due to the temporary resolution of symptoms during medication use.\\nAmong the most effective medications are those that inhibit the reuptake of serotonin, clomipramine\\nand SSRIs. Reportedly, up to 60% of patients show improvement in symptoms while taking these\\nmedications; however, symptoms are quick to return when medications are discontinued (Dougherty,\\nRauch, & Jenike, 2002). While there has been some promise in a combined treatment option of exposure\\nand response prevention and SSRIs, these findings were not superior to exposure and response\\nprevention alone, suggesting that the inclusion of medication in treatment does not provide an added\\nbenefit (Foa et al., 2005).\\n \\n9.5.2. Body Dysmorphic Disorder\\nSeeing as though there are strong similarities between OCD and body dysmorphic disorder, it should\\nnot come as a surprise that the only two effective treatments for body dysmorphic disorder are those\\nthat are effective in OCD. Exposure and response prevention has been successful in treating symptoms\\nof body dysmorphic disorder, as patients are repeatedly exposed to their body imperfections/obsessions\\nand prevented from engaging in compulsions used to reduce their anxiety.  (Veale, Gournay, et al.,\\n1996; Wilhelm, Otto, Lohr, & Deckersbach, 1999). The other treatment option, psychopharmacology,\\nhas also been shown to reduce symptoms in patients with body dysmorphic disorder. Similar to OCD,\\nmedications such as clomipramine and SSRIs are generally prescribed. While these are effective in\\nreducing body dysmorphic disorder symptoms, once medication is discontinued, symptoms resume\\nnearly immediately suggesting this is not an effective long-term treatment option for those with body\\ndysmorphic disorder.\\nTreatment of body dysmorphic disorder appears to be difficult, with one study finding that only 9% of\\nparticipants had full remission at a 1-year follow-up, and 21% reported partial remission (Phillips,\\nPagano, Menard & Stout, 2006). A more recent finding reported more promising findings, with 76% of\\nparticipants reporting full remission over 8 years (Bjornsson, Dyck, et al., 2011).\\n     9.5.2.1. Plastic surgery and medical treatments. Many individuals with body dysmorphic\\ndisorder seek out plastic surgery to attempt to correct their deficits. Phillips and colleagues (2001)\\nevaluated treatments of patients with body dysmorphic disorder and found that 76.4% of the patients\\nreported some form of plastic surgery or medical treatment, with dermatology treatment the most\\nreported (45%) followed by plastic surgery (23%). The problem with this type of treatment is that the\\nindividual is rarely satisfied with the outcome of the procedure, thus leading them to seek out additional\\nsurgeries on the same defect (Phillips et al., 2001). Therefore, it is important that medical professionals'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n200\\nthoroughly screen patients for psychological distress before completing any medical treatment.\\n \\n9.5.3. Hoarding Disorder\\nRecent research has concluded that unlike OCD, many individuals with hoarding disorder do not\\nexperience intrusive thoughts, nor do they experience urges to perform rituals. Because of this\\ndifference, treatment for hoarding disorder has moved away from exposure and response prevention,\\nand more toward a traditional cognitive-behavioral approach.\\nFrost and Hartl (1996) believed that individuals with hoarding disorder engage in complex decision-\\nmaking processes, overanalyzing the value and worth of possessions, thus leading to hoarding the\\nobject as opposed to discarding it. Therefore, in addition to having the individual engage in exposure\\ntreatment, an added component of cognitive restructuring and motivational interviewing are added to\\naddress the complex-decision making that is involved in maintaining unnecessary possessions. By\\ndiscussing motives for keeping items, as well as fears that may be associated with discarding items,\\nclinicians can assist patients in their cognitive processes to ultimately determine the item’s actual worth\\n(Williams & Viscusi, 2016). Unfortunately, due to the distressing nature of having to discard their\\npossessions, many individuals in treatment for hoarding disorder prematurely end treatment, thus never\\nreaching remission of symptoms (Mancebo, Eisen, Sibrava, Dyck, & Rasmussen, 2011).\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nTreatment options for OCD include exposure and response prevention, as well as SSRIs though\\nthe drug does not provide an added benefit in treatment.\\nTreatment options for body dysmorphic disorder include exposure and response prevention and\\ndrugs clomipramine and SSRIs.\\nTreatment options for hoarding disorder include exposure treatment, cognitive restructuring, and\\nmotivational interviewing.\\n \\nSection 9.5 Review Questions\\nDiscuss the various types of treatments for OCD.

They are very serious, yet\\nrelatively common mental health disorders, particularly in Western society, where there is a heavy\\nemphasis on thinness and physical appearance. In fact, 13% of adolescents will be diagnosed with at\\nleast one eating disorder by their 20th birthday (Stice, Marti, & Rohde, 2013). Furthermore, a large\\nnumber of adolescents will engage in significant disordered eating behaviors just below the clinical\\nthreshold (Culbert, Burt, McGue, Iacono & Klump, 2009). While there is no exact cause for eating\\ndisorders, the combination of biological, psychological, and sociocultural factors has been identified as\\nmajor contributors in both the development and maintenance of eating disorders.\\nWithin the DSM 5-TR (APA, 2022), six disorders are classified under the Feeding and Eating Disorders\\nchapter: pica, rumination disorder, avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder, anorexia nervosa, bulimia\\nnervosa, and binge-eating disorder. In this module, we will cover the latter three whose diagnostic\\ncriteria are mutually exclusive, meaning that only one of these diagnoses can be assigned at any given\\ntime due to substantial differences in their clinical course, outcome, and treatment needs, despite a\\nnumber of common psychological and behavioral features. For a discussion of the first three disorders,\\nsee Module 16 please.\\nFor more on eating disorders in general, please visit the National Eating Disorders Association website\\nbelow:\\nhttps://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/what-are-eating-disorders\\n \\n10.1.1. Anorexia Nervosa\\nAnorexia nervosa involves the restriction of energy intake, which leads to significantly low body weight\\nrelative to the individual’s age, sex, and development. This restriction is often secondary to an intense\\nfear of gaining weight or becoming fat, despite the individual’s low body weight. Altered perception of\\nself and an over-evaluation of one’s body weight and shape contribute to this disturbance of body size.\\nTypical warning signs and symptoms are divided into two different categories: emotional/behavioral and\\nphysical. Some emotional and behavioral symptoms include dramatic weight loss; preoccupation with\\nfood, weight, calories, etc.; frequent comments about feeling “fat;” eating a restricted range of foods;\\nmaking excuses to avoid mealtimes; and not eating in public. Physical changes may include dizziness,\\ndifficulty concentrating, feeling cold, sleep problems, thinning hair/hair loss, and muscle weakness, to\\nname a few. When the individual loses weight, they view this as an impressive achievement and a sign\\nof extraordinary discipline, while weight gain is seen as an unacceptable failure of self-control (APA,\\n2022).\\nThe onset of the disorder typically begins with mild dietary restrictions such as eliminating carbs or\\nspecific fatty foods. As weight loss is achieved, the dietary restrictions progress to more severe, e.g.,\\nunder 500 calories/day.  Symptoms present in adolescence or young adulthood and rarely before'),\n",

The onset of the disorder typically is preceded by a stressful life event such as\\nleaving home for college.\\nFor more on anorexia nervosa, please visit the National Eating Disorders Association website below:\\nhttps://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/learn/by-eating-disorder/anorexia\\n \\n10.1.2. Bulimia Nervosa\\nUnlike anorexia nervosa where there is solely restriction of food, bulimia nervosa involves a pattern of\\nrecurrent binge eating behaviors. Binge eating can be defined as a discrete period of time where the\\namount of food consumed is significantly more than most people would eat during a similar time period.\\nIndividuals with bulimia nervosa often report a sense of lack of control over-eating during these binge-\\neating episodes. While not always the case, these binge-eating episodes are followed by a feeling of\\ndisgust with oneself, which leads to a compensatory behavior to rid the body of the excessive calories.\\nThese compensatory behaviors include vomiting, use of laxatives, fasting (or severe restriction),\\ndiuretics or other medications, or excessive exercise. This cycle of binge eating and compensatory\\nbehaviors occurs on average, at least once a week for three months (National Eating Disorder\\nAssociation website; APA, 2022).\\nIt is important to note that while there are periods of severe calorie restriction like anorexia, the two\\ndisorders cannot be diagnosed simultaneously. Therefore, it is important to determine the individual’s\\nweight when distinguishing between anorexia and bulimia. If an individual has a significantly low body\\nweight and engages in binge/purging behaviors, the diagnosis is anorexia; if the individual does not\\nhave a significantly low body weight and engages in binge/purging behaviors, the diagnosis is bulimia.\\nSigns and symptoms of bulimia nervosa are similar to anorexia nervosa. These symptoms include but\\nare not limited to hiding food wrappers or containers after a bingeing episode, feeling uncomfortable\\neating in public, developing food rituals, limited diet, disappearing to the bathroom after eating a meal,\\nand drinking excessive amounts of water or non-caloric beverages. Additional physical changes include\\nweight fluctuations both up and down, difficulty concentrating, dizziness, sleep disturbance, and\\npossible dental problems due to purging post binge eating episode.\\nMaking Sense of the Disorders\\nThough anorexia and bulimia share some common features, they differ as follows:\\nDiagnosis anorexia …… if significantly low body weight with severe calorie restriction\\nDiagnosis bulimia … if body weight is within normal range but displays calorie restriction AND\\nbinge-eating episodes\\nSymptoms of bulimia nervosa typically present later in development – adolescence or early adulthood.\\nLike anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa initially presents with mild restrictive dietary behaviors;\\nhowever, episodes of binge eating interrupt the dietary restriction, causing bodyweight to rise around'),\n",

In response to weight gain, patients engage in compensatory behaviors or purging\\nepisodes to reduce body weight. This cycle of restriction, binge eating, and calorie reduction often\\noccurs for years before seeking help.\\nAdditionally, those with bulimia are often ashamed of their eating problems and attempt to hide the\\nsymptoms. The binge eating occurs in secrecy or as inconspicuously as possible. Common antecedents\\nof binge eating include negative affect; interpersonal stressors; dietary restraint; boredom; and\\nnegative feelings linked to body weight, shape, and food.\\nFor more on bulimia nervosa, please visit the National Eating Disorders Association website below:\\nhttps://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/learn/by-eating-disorder/bulimia\\n \\n10.1.3. Binge-Eating Disorder (BED)\\nBinge-eating disorder is similar to bulimia nervosa in that it involves recurrent binge eating episodes\\nalong with feelings of lack of control during the binge-eating episode. The binge-eating episodes are\\nassociated with at least three of the following: eating quicker than usual, eating until uncomfortably\\nfull, eating large amounts even if not hungry, eating alone, and feeling disgust with oneself or being\\ndepressed. Despite the feelings of shame and guilt post-binge, individuals with BED will not engage in\\nvomiting, excessive exercise, or other compensatory behaviors. These binge eating episodes occur on\\naverage, at least once a week for 3 months.\\nBecause these binge-eating episodes occur without compensatory behaviors, individuals with BED are\\nat risk for obesity and related health disorders. Individuals with BED report feelings of embarrassment\\nat the quantity of food consumed, and thus will often refuse to eat in public. Due to the restriction of\\neating around others, individuals with BED often engage in secret binge eating episodes in private,\\nfollowed by discrete disposal of wrappers and containers.\\nMaking Sense of the Disorders\\nThough bulimia and BED are similar, they differ as follows:\\nDiagnosis BED …… if binge eating occurs WITHOUT compensatory behaviors\\nDiagnosis bulimia … if binge eating occurs AND there are compensatory behaviors to prevent\\nweight gain\\nWhile much is still being researched about binge-eating disorder, current research indicates that the\\nonset of BED is adolescence to early adulthood but can begin later in life. Those who seek treatment\\ntend to be older than those with either bulimia or anorexia. Binge eating has been found to be common\\nin adolescent and college-age samples and for all, is associated with social role adjustment issues,\\nimpaired health-related quality of life and life satisfaction, and increased medical morbidity and\\nmortality (APA, 2022).'),\n",

Obsessive-compulsive disorder is more often seen in\\nthose with the restricting type of anorexia nervosa, whereas alcohol use disorder and other substance\\nuse disorders are more commonly seen in those with anorexia who engage in binge-eating/purging\\nbehaviors. Unfortunately, there is also a high rate of suicidality, with rates reported to be 18 times\\ngreater than in an age- and gender-matched comparison group.

However, most mood\\nand anxiety symptoms resolve once an effective treatment of bulimia is established. Substance use\\ndisorder, and in particular alcohol use disorder, is also prevalent in those with bulimia, with about a\\n30% prevalence among those with bulimia. The substance abuse begins as a compensatory behavior\\n(e.g., stimulant use is used to control appetite and weight) and over time, as the eating disorder'),\n",

There is also a percentage of individuals with bulimia nervosa\\nwho display personality features that meet the criteria for at least one personality disorder, most often\\nborderline personality disorder. Finally, about one-quarter to one-third of individuals with bulimia have\\nhad suicidal ideation and a comparable amount have attempted suicide.\\n \\n10.3.3.

While researchers have yet to identify a specific cause of eating\\ndisorders, the most compelling argument to date is that eating disorders are multidimensional\\ndisorders. This means many contributing factors lead to the development of an eating disorder. While\\nthere is likely a genetic predisposition, there are also environmental, or external factors, such as family\\ndynamics and cultural influences that impact their presentation. Research supporting these influences\\nis well documented for anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa; however, seeing as BED has only just\\nrecently been established as a formal diagnosis, research on the evolvement of BED is ongoing.\\n \\n10.4.1. Biological\\nThere is some evidence of a genetic predisposition for eating disorders, with relatives of those\\ndiagnosed with an eating disorder being up to six times more likely than other individuals to be\\ndiagnosed also. Twin concordance studies also support the gene theory. If an identical twin is diagnosed\\nwith anorexia, there is a 70% percent chance the other twin will develop anorexia in their lifetime. The\\nconcordance rate for fraternal twins (who share less genes) is 20%. While not as strong for bulimia,\\nidentical twins still display a 23% concordance rate, compared to the 9% rate for fraternal twins.\\nIn addition to hereditary causes, disruption in the neuroendocrine system is common in those with\\neating disorders (Culbert, Racine, & Klump, 2015). Unfortunately, it’s difficult for researchers to\\ndetermine if these disruptions caused the disorder or have been caused by the disorder, as\\nmanipulation of eating patterns is known to trigger changes in hormone production. With that said,\\nresearchers have explored the hypothalamus as a potential contributing factor. The hypothalamus is\\nresponsible for regulating body functions, particularly hunger and thirst (Fetissov & Mequid, 2010).\\nWithin the hypothalamus, the lateral hypothalamus is responsible for initiating hunger cues that cause\\nthe organism to eat, whereas the ventromedial hypothalamus is responsible for sending signals of\\nsatiation, telling the organism to stop eating. Clearly, a disruption in either of these structures could\\nexplain why an individual may not take in enough calories or experience periods of overeating.\\n \\n10.4.2. Cognitive\\nSome argue that eating disorders are, in fact, a variant of obsessive-compulsive disorder  (OCD). The\\nobsession with body shape and weight—the hallmark of an eating disorder—is likely a driving factor in\\nanorexia nervosa. Distorted thought patterns and an over-evaluation of body size likely contribute to\\nthis obsession and one’s desire for thinness. Research has identified high levels of impulsivity,\\nparticularly in those with binge eating episodes, suggesting a temporary lack of control is responsible\\nfor these episodes. Post binge-eating episode, many individuals report feelings of disgust or even\\nthoughts of failure. These strong cognitive factors are indicative as to why cognitive-behavioral therapy\\nis the preferred treatment for eating disorders.\\n \\n10.4.3. Sociocultural\\nEating disorders are overwhelmingly found in Western countries where there is a heavy emphasis on\\nthinness—a core feature of eating disorders. It is also found in countries where food is in abundance, as'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n212\\nin places of deprivation, round figures are viewed as more desirable (Polivy & Herman, 2002). While\\neating disorders were once thought of as disorders of higher SES, recent research suggests that as our\\ncountry becomes more homogenized, the more universal eating disorders become.\\n     10.4.3.1. Media. One commonly discussed contributor to eating disorders is the media. The\\nidealization of thin models and actresses sends the message to young women (and adolescents) that to\\nbe popular and attractive, you must be thin. These images are not isolated to magazines, but are also\\nseen in television shows, movies, commercials, and large advertisements on billboards and hanging in\\nstore windows. With the emergence of social media (e.g., Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram), exposure to\\nmedia images and celebrities is even easier.  Couple this with the ability to alter images to make\\nindividuals even thinner, it is no wonder many young people become dissatisfied with their body (Polivy\\n& Herman, 2004).\\n     10.4.3.2. Ethnicity. While eating disorders are not solely a “white woman” disorder, there are\\nsignificant discrepancies when it comes to race, especially for anorexia nervosa. Why is this? Research\\nindicates that black men prefer heavier women than do white men (Greenberg & Laporte, 1996). Given\\nthis preference, it should not be surprising that black women and children have larger ideal physiques\\nthan their white peers (Polivy & Herman, 2000). Since black women are less driven to thinness, black\\nwomen would appear to be less likely to develop anorexia; however, findings suggest this is not the\\ncase. Caldwell and colleagues (1997) found that high-income black women were equally as dissatisfied\\nas high-income white women with their physique, suggesting body image issues may be more closely\\nrelated to SES than that of race. The race discrepancies are also less significant in BED, where the\\nprominent feature of the eating disorder is not thinness (Polivy & Herman, 2002).\\n     10.4.3.3. Gender. Males account for only a small percentage of eating disorders. While it is unclear\\nas to why there is such a discrepancy, it is likely somewhat related to cultural desires of women being\\n“thin” and men being “muscular” or “strong.”\\nOf men diagnosed with an eating disorder, the overwhelming percentage of them identified a job or\\nsport as the primary reason for their eating behaviors (Strother, Lemberg, Stanford, & Turberville,\\n2012). Jockeys, distance runners, wrestlers, and bodybuilders are some of the professions identified as\\nmost restrictive regarding body weight.\\nThere is some speculation that males are not diagnosed as frequently as women due to the stigma\\nattached to eating disorders. Eating disorders have routinely been characterized as a “white, adolescent\\nfemale” problem. Due to this bias, young men may not seek help for their eating disorder in efforts to\\nprevent labeling (Raevuoni, Keski-Rahkonen & Hoek, 2014).\\n     10.4.3.4. Family. Family influences are one of the strongest external contributors to maintaining\\neating disorders. Often family members are praised for their slenderness. Think about the last time you\\nsaw a family member or close friend- how often have you said, “You look great!” or commented on their\\nappearance in some way? The odds are likely high. While the intent of the family member is not to\\nmaintain maladaptive eating behaviors by praising the physical appearance of someone struggling with\\nan eating disorder, they are indirectly perpetuating the disorder.\\nWhile family involvement can help maintain the disorder, it can also contribute to the development of an\\neating disorder. Families that emphasize thinness or place a large emphasis on physical appearance are\\nmore likely to have a child diagnosed with an eating disorder (Zerbe, 2008). In fact, mothers with eating\\ndisorders are more likely to have children who develop a feeding/eating disorder than mothers without'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n213\\neating disorders (Whelan & Cooper, 2000). Additional family characteristics that are common among\\npatients receiving treatment for eating disorders are enmeshed, intrusive, critical, hostile, or overly\\nconcerned with parenting (Polivy & Herman, 2002). While there has been some correlation between\\nthese family dynamics and eating disorders, they are not evident in all families of people with eating\\ndisorders.\\n \\n10.4.4. Personality\\nThere are many personality characteristics that are common in individuals with eating disorders. While\\nit is unknown if these characteristics are inherent in the individual’s personality or a product of\\npersonal experiences, the thought is eating disorders develop due to the combination of the two.\\n     10.4.4.1. Perfectionism. It should come as no surprise that perfectionism, or the belief that one\\nmust be perfect, is a contributing factor to disorders related to eating, weight, and body shape\\n(particularly anorexia nervosa). While an exact mechanism is unknown, it is believed that perfectionism\\nmagnifies normal body imperfections, leading an individual to go to extreme (i.e., restrictive) behaviors\\nto remedy the flaw (Hewitt, Flett & Ediger, 1995).\\n     10.4.4.2. Self-Esteem. Self-esteem, or one’s belief in their worth or ability, has routinely been\\nidentified as a moderator of many psychological disorders, and eating disorders are no exception. Low\\nself-esteem not only contributes to the development of an eating disorder but is also likely involved in\\nthe maintenance of the disorder. One theory, the transdiagnostic model of eating disorders, suggests\\nthat overall low self-esteem increases the risk for over-evaluation of body, which in turn, leads to\\nnegative eating behaviors that could lead to an eating disorder (Fairburn, Cooper & Shafran, 2003).\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nBiological causes of eating disorders include a genetic predisposition and disruption in the\\nneuroendocrine system.\\nCognitive causes of eating disorders include distorted thought patterns and an over-evaluation of\\nbody size.\\nSociocultural causes of eating disorders include the idealization of thin models and actresses by\\nthe media, SES, gender, and family involvement.\\nThe personality trait of perfectionism and low self-esteem are contributing factors to disorders\\nrelated to eating, weight, and body shape.\\n \\nSection 10.4 Review Questions\\nDefine multidimensional disorders?1.\\nWhat evidence is there to suggest eating disorders are biologically driven?2.'),\n",

Treatment\\n \\nSection Learning Objectives\\nDescribe treatment options for anorexia nervosa.\\nDescribe treatment options for bulimia nervosa.\\nDescribe treatment options for binge eating disorder.\\nDiscuss the outcome of treatment for feeding and eating disorders.\\n \\n10.5.1. Anorexia Nervosa\\nThe immediate goal for the treatment of anorexia nervosa is weight gain and recovery from\\nmalnourishment. This is often established via an intensive outpatient program, or if needed, through an\\ninpatient hospitalization program where caloric intake can be managed and controlled. Both the\\ninpatient and outpatient programs use a combination of therapies and support to help restore proper\\neating habits. Of the most common (and successful) treatments are Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)\\nand Family-Based Therapy (FBT).\\n     10.5.1.1. CBT. Because anorexia nervosa requires changes to both eating behaviors as well as\\nthought patterns, CBT strategies have been very effective in producing lasting changes to those\\nsuffering from anorexia nervosa. Some of the behavioral strategies include recording eating\\nbehaviors—hunger pains, quality and quantity of food—and emotional behaviors—feelings related to the\\nfood. In addition to these behavioral strategies, it is also important to address the maladaptive thought\\npatterns associated with their negative body image and desire to control their physical characteristics.\\nChanging the fear related to gaining weight is essential in recovery.\\n     10.5.1.2. Family based therapy (FBT). FBT is also an effective treatment approach, often used as\\na component of individual CBT, especially for children and adolescents with the disorder. FBT has been\\nshown to elicit 50-60% of weight restoration in one year, as well as weight maintenance 2-4 years post-\\ntreatment (Campbell & Peebles, 2014; LeGrange, Lock, Accurso, Agras, Darcy, Forsberg, et al, 2014).\\nAdditionally, FBT has been shown to improve rapid weight gain, produce fewer hospitalizations, and is\\nmore cost-effective than other types of therapies with family involvement (Agras, Lock, Brandt, Bryson,\\nDodge, Halmi, et al., 2014).'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n215\\nFBT typically involves 16-18 sessions which are divided into 3 phases: (1) Parents take charge of weight\\nrestoration, (2) client’s gradual control of overeating, and (3) addressing developmental issues including\\nfostering autonomy from parents (Chen, et al., 2016). While FBT has shown to be effective in treating\\nadolescents with anorexia nervosa, the application for older eating patients (i.e., college-aged students\\nand above) is still undetermined. As with adolescents, the goal for a family-based treatment program\\nshould center around helping the patient separate their feelings and needs from that of their family.\\n \\n10.5.2. Bulimia Nervosa\\nJust as anorexia nervosa treatment initially focuses on weight gain, the first goal of bulimia nervosa\\ntreatment is to eliminate binge eating episodes and compensatory behaviors. The aim is to replace both\\nnegative behaviors with positive eating habits. One of the most effective ways to establish this is\\nthrough Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).\\n     10.5.2.1. CBT. Similar to anorexia nervosa, individuals with bulimia nervosa are expected to keep a\\njournal of their eating habits; however, with bulimia nervosa, it is also important that the journal\\ninclude changes in sensations of hunger and fullness, as well as other feelings surrounding their eating\\npatterns in efforts to identify triggers to their binging episodes (Agras, Fitzsimmons-Craft & Wilfley,\\n2017). Once these triggers are identified, psychologists will utilize specific behavioral or cognitive\\ntechniques to prevent the individual from engaging in binge episodes or compensatory behaviors.\\nOne method for modifying behaviors is through Exposure and Response Prevention. As previously\\ndiscussed in the OCD chapter, this treatment is very effective in helping individuals stop performing\\ntheir compulsive behaviors by literally preventing them from engaging in the action, while\\nsimultaneously using relaxation strategies to reduce anxiety associated with not engaging in the\\nnegative behavior. Therefore, to prevent an individual from purging post-binge episodes, the individual\\nwould be encouraged to partake in an activity that directly competes with their ability to purge, e.g.,\\nwrite their thoughts and feelings in a journal at the kitchen table. Research has indicated that this\\ntreatment is particularly helpful for individuals suffering from comorbid anxiety disorders (particularly\\nOCD; Agras, Fitzsimmons-Craft & Wilfley, 2017).\\nIn addition to changing behaviors, it is also important to change the maladaptive thoughts toward food,\\neating, weight, and shape. Negative thoughts such as “I am fat” and “I can’t stop eating when I start”\\ncan be modified into more appropriate thoughts such as “My body is healthy” or “I can control my\\neating habits.”  By replacing these negative thoughts with more appropriate, positive thought patterns,\\nindividuals begin to control their feelings, which in return, can help them manage their behaviors.\\n     10.5.2.2. Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT). IPT has also been established as an effective\\ntreatment for those with bulimia nervosa, particularly if an individual has not been successful with CBT\\ntreatment. The goal of IPT is to improve interpersonal functioning in those with eating disorders.\\nOriginally a treatment for depression, IPT-E was adapted to address the social isolation and self-esteem\\nproblems that contribute to the maintenance of negative eating behaviors.\\nIPT-E has 3 phases typically covered in weekly sessions over 4-5 months. Phase One consists of\\nengaging the patient in treatment and providing psychoeducation about their disease and the treatment\\nprogram. This phase also includes identifying interpersonal problems that are maintaining the disease.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n216\\nPhase Two is the main treatment component. In this phase, the primary focus is on problem-solving\\ninterpersonal issues. The most common types of interpersonal issues are lack of intimacy and\\ninterpersonal deficits, interpersonal role disputes, role transitions, grief, and life goals. Once the main\\ninterpersonal problem is identified, the clinician supports the patient in their pursuit to identify ways to\\nchange. A key component of IPT-E is the supportive role of the clinician, as opposed to the teaching role\\nin other treatments. The idea is that by having the patient make changes, they can better understand\\ntheir problems, and as a result, make more profound changes (Murphy, Straebler, Basden, Cooper, &\\nFairburn, 2012).\\nPhase Three is the final stage. The goals of this phase are to ensure that the changes made in Phase two\\nare maintained. To achieve this, treatment sessions are spaced out, allowing patients more time to\\nengage in their changed behavior. Additionally, relapse prevention (i.e., problem-solving ways not to\\nrelapse) is also discussed to ensure long term results. In doing this, the patient reviews the progress\\nthey have made throughout treatment, as well as identifying potential interpersonal issues that may\\narise, and how their treatment can be adapted to address those issues.\\nSupport for IPT-E is limited; however, two extensive studies suggest that IPT-E is effective in treating\\nbulimia nervosa, and possibly BED. While treatment is initially slower than CBT, it is equally effective in\\nlong-term follow-up and maintenance of disorder (Fairburn, Marcus, & Wilson, 1993).\\n \\n10.5.3. Binge Eating Disorder\\nGiven the similar presentations of BED and bulimia nervosa, it should not be surprising that the most\\neffective treatments for BED are similar to that of bulimia nervosa. CBT, along with antidepressant\\nmedications, are among the most effective in treating BED. Interpersonal therapy, as well as dialectical\\nbehavioral therapy, have also been effective in reducing binge-eating episodes; however, they have not\\nbeen effective in weight loss (Guerdjikova, Mori, Casuto, & McElroy, 2017). Goals of treatment are, of\\ncourse, to eliminate binge eating episodes, as well as reduce body weight as most individuals with BED\\nare overweight. Seeing as BED has only recently been established as a separate eating disorder,\\ntreatment research specific to this disorder is expected to grow.\\n     10.5.3.1. Antidepressant medications. Given the high comorbidity between eating disorders and\\ndepressive symptoms, antidepressants have been a primary method of treatment for years. While they\\nhave been shown to improve depressive symptoms, which may help individuals make gains in their\\neating disorder treatment, research has not supported antidepressants as an effective treatment\\nstrategy for treating the eating disorder itself.\\n \\n10.5.4. Outcome of Treatment\\nNow that we have discussed treatments for eating disorders, how effective are they? Research has\\nindicated favorable prognostic features for anorexia nervosa are early age of onset and a short history\\nof the disorder. Conversely, unfavorable features are a long history of symptoms prior to treatment,\\nsevere weight loss, and binge eating and vomiting. The mortality rate over the first 10 years from\\npresentation is about 10%. Most of these deaths are from medical complications due to the disorder or\\nsuicide.'),\n",

However, there is some speculation that individuals with childhood obesity, low self-esteem,\\nand those with a personality disorder have worse treatment outcomes.

Defining Terms and Adding Context\\nSubstance-related and addictive disorders are among the most prevalent psychological disorders, with\\nroughly 100 million people in the United States reporting the use of an illegal substance sometime\\nthroughout their life (SAMHSA, 2014). It is worth noting that the DSM-5 shifted terminology from drug\\naddiction to substance use disorder, “…to describe the wide range of the disorder, from a mild form to a\\nsevere state of chronically relapsing, compulsive pattern of drug taking.” The DSM-5 acknowledges that\\nmany clinicians will use the term drug addiction to describe more severe presentations, but it is omitted\\nfrom the DSM-5 due to “…its uncertain definition and its potentially negative connotation” (APA, 2022,\\npg. 543).\\nWhat are substances? Substances are any ingested materials that cause temporary cognitive,\\nbehavioral, or physiological symptoms within the individual. The DSM uses 10 classes of substances:\\nalcohol, caffeine, cannabis, hallucinogens, inhalants, opioids, sedatives, stimulants, tobacco, and other\\n(or unknown).\\nRepeated use of these substances or frequent substance intoxication can develop into a long-term\\nproblem known as substance abuse. Abuse occurs when an individual consumes the substance for an\\nextended period or must ingest large amounts of the substance to get the same effect a substance\\nprovided previously. The need to continually increase the amount of ingested substance is known as\\ntolerance. As tolerance builds, additional physical and psychological symptoms present, often causing\\nsignificant disturbances in an individual’s personal and professional life. Individuals with substance\\nabuse often spend a significant amount of time engaging in activities that revolve around their\\nsubstance use, thus spending less time in recreational activities that once consumed their time.\\nSometimes, there is a desire to reduce or abstain from substance use; however, cravings and\\nwithdrawal symptoms often prohibit this from occurring. Common withdrawal symptoms include, but\\nare not limited to, cramps, anxiety attacks, sweating, nausea, tremors, and hallucinations. Depending on\\nthe substance and the tolerance level, most withdrawal symptoms last anywhere from a few days to a\\nweek. For those with extensive substance abuse or abuse of multiple substances, withdrawal should be\\nclosely monitored in a hospital setting to avoid severe consequences such as seizures, stroke, or even\\ndeath.\\nAccording to the DSM-5-TR (APA, 2022), the substance-related disorders are divided into two groups:\\nsubstance use disorders and substance-induced disorders which include substance intoxication and\\nsubstance withdrawal. While there are some subtle differences in symptoms, particularly psychological,\\nphysical, and behavioral symptoms, the general diagnostic criteria for substance use disorder,\\nsubstance intoxication, and substance withdrawal remains the same across substances. These\\ncriteria are reviewed below, with more specific details of psychological, physical, and behavioral\\nsymptoms in the Section 11.1.5.: Types of Substances Abused.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n220\\n \\n11.1.2. Substance Use Disorder\\nThe essential feature of substance use disorder, is a “…cluster of cognitive, behavioral, and\\nphysiological symptoms indicating that the individual continues using the substance despite significant\\nsubstance-related problems” (APA, 2022, pg. 544) and can be diagnosed for all ten substance classes\\nexcept for caffeine. Distress or impairment can be described as any of the following: inability to\\ncomplete or lack of participation in work, school or home activities; increased time spent on activities\\nobtaining, using, or recovering from substance use; impairment in social or interpersonal relationships;\\nuse of a substance in a potentially hazardous situation; psychological problems due to recurrent\\nsubstance abuse; craving the substance; an increase in the amount of substance used over time (i.e.,\\ntolerance); difficulty reducing the amount of substance used despite a desire to reduce/stop using;\\nand/or withdrawal symptoms (APA, 2022). While the number of these symptoms may vary among\\nindividuals, only two symptoms are required for a diagnosis of substance use disorder.\\n \\n11.1.3. Substance Intoxication\\nFor a diagnosis of substance intoxication, the individual must have recently ingested a substanc.\\nImmediately following the ingestion of this substance, significant behavioral and/or psychological\\nchange is observed. In addition, physical and physiological symptoms present as a direct result of the\\nsubstance ingested. As stated above, these behavioral, physical, and physiological symptoms are\\ndependent on the type of substance that is ingested and, therefore, discussed in more detail within each\\nsubstance category (i.e., depressants, stimulants, hallucinogens/cannabis/combination). This said, the\\nmost common changes involve disturbances of perception, wakefulness, attention, thinking,\\npsychomotor behavior, interpersonal behavior, and judgment (APA, 2022).\\n \\n11.1.4. Substance Withdrawal\\nFinally, substance withdrawal is diagnosed when there is cessation or reduction of a substance that\\nhas been used for a long period of time. Individuals undergoing substance withdrawal will experience\\nphysiological and psychological symptoms within a few hours after cessation/reduction. These\\nsymptoms cause significant distress or impairment in daily functioning (APA, 2022). As with substance\\nintoxication, physiological and psychological symptoms during substance withdrawal are often specific\\nto the substance abused and are discussed in more detail within each substance category later in the\\nmodule.\\n \\n11.1.5. Types of Substances Abused\\nFor our purposes, the most abused substances will be divided into three categories based on how they\\nimpact one’s physiological state: depressants, stimulants, and hallucinogens/cannabis/combination.\\n     11.1.5.1.

Unfortunately, when used in large amounts, they can also impair an\\nindividual’s judgment and motor activity.\\nWhile alcohol is one of the only legal (over-the-counter) substances we will discuss, it is also the most\\ncommonly consumed substance. According to the 2015 National Survey on Drug Use and Health,\\napproximately 70% of individuals drank an alcoholic beverage in the last year, and nearly 56% of\\nindividuals drank an alcoholic beverage in the past month (SAMHSA, 2015). While the legal age of\\nconsumption in the United States is 21, approximately 78% of teens report that they drank alcohol at\\nsome point in their life (SAMHSA, 2013).\\nDespite the legal age of consumption, many college-aged students engage in binge or heavy drinking. In\\nfact, 45% of college-aged students report engaging in binge drinking, with 14% binge drinking at least\\n5 days per month (SAMHSA, 2013). In addition to these high levels of alcohol consumption, students\\nalso engage in other behaviors such as skipping meals, which can impact the rate of alcohol intoxication\\nand place them at risk for dehydration, blacking out, and developing alcohol-induced seizures (Piazza-\\nGardner & Barry, 2013).\\nThe “active” substance of alcohol, ethyl alcohol, is a chemical that is absorbed quickly into the blood via\\nthe lining of the stomach and intestine. Once in the bloodstream, ethyl alcohol travels to the central\\nnervous system (i.e., brain and spinal cord) and produces depressive symptoms such as impaired\\nreaction time, disorientation, and slurred speech. These symptoms are produced due to the ethyl\\nalcohol binding to GABA receptors, thus preventing GABA from providing inhibitory messages and\\nallowing the individual to relax (Filip et al., 2015).\\nThe effect of ethyl alcohol in moderation allows for an individual to relax, engage more readily in\\nconversation, and in general, produce a confident and happy personality. However, when consumption\\nis increased or excessive, the central nervous system is unable to metabolize the ethyl alcohol\\nadequately, and adverse effects begin to present. Symptoms such as blurred vision, difficulty walking,\\nslurred speech, slowed reaction time, and sometimes, aggressive behaviors are observed.\\nThe extent to which these symptoms present are directly related to the concentration of ethyl alcohol\\nwithin the body, as well as the individual’s ability to metabolize the ethyl alcohol. There are a lot of\\nfactors that contribute to how quickly one’s body can metabolize ethyl alcohol. Food, gender, body\\nweight, and medications are among the most common factors that affect alcohol absorption\\n(NIAAA,1997). More specifically, recent consumption of food, particularly those high in fat and\\ncarbohydrates, slow the absorption rate of ethyl alcohol, thus reducing its effects. Regarding gender,\\nwomen absorb and metabolize alcohol differently than men, likely due to the smaller amount of body\\nwater and the lower activity of an alcohol metabolizing enzyme in the stomach. Another factor related\\nto gender is weight—with individuals with more body mass metabolizing the alcohol at a slower rate\\nthan those who weigh less. Finally, various medications, both over the counter and prescription, can\\nimpact the liver’s ability to metabolize alcohol, thus affecting the severity of symptoms that present\\n(NIAAA, 1997).\\nSedative-Hypnotic drugs, more commonly known as anxiolytic drugs, have a calming and relaxing\\neffect on individuals. When used at a clinically appropriate dosage, they can have a sedative effect, thus\\nmaking them a suitable drug for treating anxiety-related disorders. In the early 1900s, barbiturates\\nwere introduced as the main sedative and hypnotic drug; however, due to their addictive nature, as well'),\n",

This increase in\\nGABA produces a sedative and calming effect. Benzodiazepines can be prescribed for both temporary\\nrelief (pre-flight or before surgery) or long-term use (generalized anxiety disorder). While they do not\\nproduce respiratory distress in large dosages like barbiturates, they can cause intoxication and\\naddictive behaviors due to their effects on tolerance.\\nOpioids are naturally occurring, derived from the sap of the opium poppy. In the early 1800s,\\nmorphine was isolated from opium by German chemist Friedrich Wilhelm Adam Serturner. Due to its\\nanalgesic effect, it was named after the Greek god of dreams, Morpheus (Brownstein, 1993). Its\\npopularity grew during the American Civil War as it was the primary medication given to soldiers with\\nbattle injuries. Unfortunately, this is also when the addictive nature of the medication was discovered,\\nas many soldiers developed “Soldier’s Disease” as a response to tolerance of the drug (Casey, 1978).\\nIn an effort to alleviate the addictive nature of morphine, heroin was synthesized by the German\\nchemical company Bayer in 1898 and was offered in a cough suppressant (Yes, Bayer promoted heroin).\\nFor years, heroin remained in cough suppressants as well as other pain reducers until it was discovered\\nthat heroin was more addictive than morphine. In 1917, Congress stated that all drugs derived from\\nopium were addictive, thus banning the use of opioids in over-the-counter medications.\\nOpioids are unique in that they provide both euphoria and drowsiness. Tolerance to these drugs builds\\nquickly, thus resulting in an increased need of the medication to produce desired effects. This rapid\\ntolerance is also likely responsible for opioids’ highly addictive nature. Opioid withdrawal symptoms can\\nrange from restlessness, muscle pain, fatigue, anxiety, and insomnia. Unfortunately, these withdrawal\\nsymptoms, as well as intense cravings for the drug, can persist for several months, with some reports\\nup to years. Because of the intensity and longevity of these withdrawal symptoms, many individuals\\nstruggle to remain abstinent, and accidental overdoses are common (CDC, 2013).\\nThe rise of abuse and misuse of opioid products in the early-to-mid 2000s is a direct result of the\\nincreased number of opioid prescription medications containing oxycodone and hydrocodone (Jayawant\\n& Balkrishnana, 2005). The 2015 report estimated 12.5 million Americans had abused prescription\\nnarcotic pain relievers in the past year (SAMHSA, 2016). In an effort to reduce such abuse, the FDA\\ndeveloped programs to educate prescribers about the risks of misuse and abuse of opioid medications.\\n     11.1.5.2. Stimulants. The two most common types of stimulants abused are cocaine and\\namphetamines. Unlike depressants that reduce the activity of the central nervous system, stimulants\\nhave the opposite effect, increasing the activity in the central nervous system. Physiological changes\\nthat occur with stimulants are increased blood pressure, heart rate, pressured thinking/speaking, and\\nrapid, often jerky behaviors. Because of these symptoms, stimulants are commonly used for their\\nfeelings of euphoria, to reduce appetite, and prevent sleep.\\nSimilar to opioids, cocaine is extracted from a South American plant—the coca plant—and produces\\nfeelings of energy and euphoria. It is the most potent natural stimulant known to date (Acosta et al.,\\n2011). Low doses can produce feelings of excitement, talkativeness, and euphoria; however, as the\\namount of ingested cocaine increases, physiological changes such as rapid breathing, increased blood'),\n",

The psychological and physiological effects of cocaine\\nare due to an increase of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin in various brain structures (Hart &\\nKsir, 2014; Haile, 2012).\\nOne key feature of cocaine use is the rapid high of cocaine intoxication, followed by the quick depletion,\\nor crashing, as the drug diminishes within the body. During the euphoric intoxication, individuals will\\nexperience poor muscle coordination, grandiosity, compulsive behavior, aggression, and possible\\nhallucinations and delusions (Haile, 2012). Conversely, as the drug leaves the system, the individual will\\nexperience adverse effects such as headaches, dizziness, and fainting (Acosta et al., 2011). These\\nnegative feelings often produce a negative feedback loop, encouraging individuals to ingest more\\ncocaine to alleviate the negative symptoms. This also increases the chance of accidental overdose.\\nCocaine is unique in that it can be ingested in various ways. While cocaine was initially snorted via the\\nnasal cavity, individuals found that if the drug was smoked or injected, its effects were more potent and\\nlonger-lasting (Haile, 2012). The most common way cocaine is currently ingested is via freebasing,\\nwhich involves heating cocaine with ammonia to extract the cocaine base. This method produces a form\\nof cocaine that is almost 100% pure. Due to its low melting point, freebased cocaine is easy to smoke via\\na glass pipe. Inhaled cocaine is absorbed into the bloodstream and brain within 10-15 seconds\\nsuggesting its effects are felt almost immediately (Addiction Centers of America).\\nCrack is a derivative of cocaine that is formed by combining cocaine with water and another substance\\n(commonly baking soda) to create a solid structure that is then broken into smaller pieces. Because of\\nthis process, it requires very little cocaine to make crack, thus making it a more affordable drug. Coined\\nfor the crackling sound that is produced when it is smoked, it is also highly addictive, likely due to the\\nfast-acting nature of the drug. While the effects of cocaine peak in 20-30 minutes and last for about 1-2\\nhours, the effects of crack peak in 3-5 minutes and last only for up to 60 minutes (Addiction Centers of\\nAmerica).\\nAmphetamines are manufactured in a laboratory setting. Currently, the most common amphetamines\\nare prescription medications such as Ritalin, Adderall, and Dexedrine (prescribed for sleep disorders).\\nThese medications produce an increase in energy and alertness and reduce appetite when taken at\\nclinical levels. However, when consumed at larger dosages, they can produce intoxication similar to\\npsychosis, including violent behaviors. Due to the increased energy levels and appetite suppressant\\nqualities, these medications are often abused by students studying for exams, athletes needing extra\\nenergy, and individuals seeking weight loss (Haile, 2012). Biologically, similar to cocaine,\\namphetamines affect the central nervous system by increasing the amount of dopamine,\\nnorepinephrine, and serotonin in the brain (Haile, 2012).\\nMethamphetamine, a derivative of amphetamine, is often abused due to its low cost and feelings of\\neuphoria and confidence; however, it can have serious health consequences such as heart and lung\\ndamage (Hauer, 2010). Most commonly used intravenously or nasally, methamphetamine can also be\\neaten or heated to a temperature in which it can be smoked. The most notable effects of\\nmethamphetamine use are the drastic physical changes to one’s appearance, including significant teeth\\ndamage and facial lesions (Rusyniak, 2011).\\nWhile we are sure you are well aware of how caffeine is consumed, you may be surprised to learn that\\nin addition to coffee, energy drinks, and soft drinks, caffeine can also be found in chocolate and tea.\\nBecause of the vast use of caffeine, it is the most widely consumed substance in the world, with'),\n",

While caffeine is often consumed in moderate dosages, caffeine intoxication and\\nwithdrawal can occur. In fact, an increase in caffeine intoxication and withdrawal have been observed\\nwith the simultaneous popularity of energy drinks. Common energy drinks such as Monster and RedBull\\nhave nearly double the amount of caffeine of tea and coke (Bigard, 2010). While adults commonly\\nconsume these drinks, a startling 30% of middle and high schoolers also report regular consumption of\\nenergy drinks to assist with academic and athletic responsibilities (Terry-McElrath, O’Malley, &\\nJohnston, 2014). The rapid increase in caffeinated beverages has led to a rise in ER visits due to the\\nintoxication effects (SAMHSA, 2013).\\n     11.1.5.3. Hallucinogens/Cannabis/Combination. The final category includes both hallucinogens\\nand cannabis- both of which produce sensory changes after ingestion. While hallucinogens are known\\nfor their ability to produce more severe delusions and hallucinations, cannabis also has the capability of\\nproducing delusions or hallucinations; however, this typically occurs only when large amounts of\\ncannabis are ingested. More commonly, cannabis has been known to have stimulant and depressive\\neffects, thus classifying itself in a group of its own due to the many different effects of the substance.\\nHallucinogens come from natural sources and have been involved in cultural and religious ceremonies\\nfor thousands of years. Synthetic forms of hallucinogens have also been created—most common of\\nwhich are PCP, Ketamine, LSD, and Ecstasy. In general, hallucinogens produce powerful changes in\\nsensory perception. Depending on the type of drug ingested, effects can range from hallucinations,\\nchanges in color perception, or distortion of objects. Additionally, some individuals report enhanced\\nauditory, as well as changes in physical perception such as tingling or numbness of limbs and\\ninterchanging hot and cold sensations (Weaver & Schnoll, 2008). Interestingly, the effect of\\nhallucinogens can vary both between individuals, as well as within the same individual. This means that\\nthe same amount of the same drug may produce a positive experience one time, but a negative\\nexperience the next time.\\nOverall, hallucinogens do not have addictive qualities; however, individuals can build a tolerance, thus\\nneeding larger quantities to produce similar effects (Wu, Ringwalt, Weiss, & Blazer, 2009).\\nFurthermore, there is some evidence that long-term use of these drugs results in psychosis, mood, or\\nanxiety disorders due to the neurobiological changes after using hallucinogens (Weaver & Schnoll,\\n2008).\\nSimilar to hallucinogens and a few other substances, cannabis is also derived from a natural plant—the\\nhemp plant. While the most powerful of hemp plants is hashish, the most commonly known type of\\ncannabis, marijuana, is a mixture of hemp leaves, buds, and the tops of plants (SAMHSA, 2014). Many\\nexternal factors impact the potency of cannabis, such as the climate it was grown in, the method of\\npreparation, and the duration of storage. Of the active chemicals within cannabis,\\ntetrahydrocannabinol (THC) appears to be the single component that determines the potent nature\\nof the drug. Various strains of marijuana have varying amounts of THC; hashish contains a high\\nconcentration of THC, while marijuana has a small concentration.\\nTHC binds to cannabinoid receptors in the brain, which produces psychoactive effects. These effects\\nvary depending on both an individual’s body chemistry, as well as various strains and concentrations of\\nTHC. Most commonly, people report feelings of calm and peace, relaxation, increased hunger, and pain\\nrelief. Occasionally, negative symptoms such as increased anxiety or paranoia, dizziness, and increased\\nheart rate also occur. In rare cases, individuals develop psychotic symptoms or schizophrenia following'),\n",

Of particular concern is the number of adolescents\\nengaging in cannabis use. One in eight 8th graders, one in four 10th graders, and one in three 12th\\ngraders reported use of marijuana in the past year (American Academy of Child and Adolescent\\nPsychiatry, 2013). Individuals who begin cannabis abuse during adolescence are at an increased risk of\\ndeveloping cognitive effects from the drug due to the critical period of brain development during\\nadolescence (Gruber, Sagar, Dahlgren, Racine, & Lukas, 2012). Increased discussion about the effects\\nof marijuana use, as well as psychoeducation about substance abuse in general, is important in\\npreventing marijuana use during adolescence.\\n11.1.5.4. Using drugs in combination. It is not uncommon for substance abusers to consume more\\nthan one type of substance at a time. This combination of substance use can have dangerous results\\ndepending on the interactions between substances. For example, if multiple depressant drugs (i.e.,\\nalcohol, benzodiazepines, and/or opiates) are consumed at one time, an individual is at risk for severe\\nrespiratory distress or even death due to the compounding depressive effects on the central nervous\\nsystem. Additionally, when an individual is under the influence of one substance, judgment may be\\nimpaired, and ingestion of a larger amount of another drug may lead to an accidental overdose. Finally,\\nthe use of one drug to counteract the effects of another drug—taking a depressant to combat the effects\\nof a stimulant—is equally as dangerous as the body is unable to regulate homeostasis.\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nAn individual is diagnosed with substance use disorder, substance intoxication, or substance\\nwithdrawal specific to the substance or substances being ingested though the symptoms remain\\ngenerally the same across substances.\\nSubstance use disorder occurs when a person experiences significant impairment or distress for\\n12 months due to the use of a substance.\\nSubstance intoxication occurs when a person has recently ingested a substance leading to\\nsignificant behavioral and/or psychological changes.\\nSubstance withdrawal occurs when there is a cessation or reduction of a substance that has been\\nused for a long period of time.\\nDepressants include alcohol, sedative-hypnotic drugs, and opioids.\\nStimulants include cocaine and amphetamines, but caffeine as well.\\nHallucinogens come from natural sources and produce powerful changes in sensory perception.\\nCannabis is also derived from a natural plant and produces psychoactive effects.\\nMany drugs are taken by users in combination which can have dangerous results depending on\\nthe interactions between the substances.\\n \\nSection 11.1 Review Questions'),\n",

Comorbidity\\n \\nSection Learning Objectives\\nDescribe the comorbidity of substance-related and addictive disorders.\\n \\nSubstance abuse, in general, has a high comorbidity within itself (meaning abuse of multiple different\\nsubstances), as well as with other mental health disorders. Researchers believe that substance abuse\\ndisorders are often secondary to another mental health disorder, as the substance abuse develops as a\\nmeans to “self-medicate” the underlying psychological disorder. In fact, several large surveys identified\\nalcohol and drug dependence to be twice as more likely in individuals with anxiety, affective, and\\npsychotic disorders than the general public (Hartz et al., 2014). While it is difficult to identify exact\\nestimates of the relationship between substance abuse and serious mental health disorders, the\\nconsensus among researchers is that there is a strong relationship between substance abuse and mood,\\nanxiety, PTSD, and personality disorders (Grant et al., 2016).\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nSubstance abuse has a high comorbidity within itself and with mental health disorders such as\\nmood, anxiety, PTSD, and personality disorders.\\n \\nSection 11.3 Review Questions\\nWith what other conditions are substance-related and addictive disorders highly comorbid?\\n \\n11.4.

Biological\\n     11.4.1.1. Genetics. Similar to other mental health disorders, substance abuse is genetically\\ninfluenced.  With that said, it is different than other mental health disorders in that if the individual is\\nnot exposed to the substance, they will not develop substance abuse.\\nHeritability of alcohol abuse is among the most well studied substances, likely because it is the only\\nlegal substance (except cannabis in some states). Twin studies have indicated a range of 50-60%\\nheritability risk for alcohol disorder (Kendler et al., 1997). Studies exploring the heritability of other\\nsubstance abuse, particularly drug use, suggests there may be a stronger heritability link than\\npreviously thought (Jang, Livesley, & Vernon, 1995). Twin studies indicate that the genetic component\\nof drug abuse is stronger than drug use in general, meaning that genetic factors are more significant\\nfor abuse of a substance over nonproblematic use (Tsuang et al., 1996). Merikangas and colleagues\\n(1998) found an 8-fold increased risk for developing a substance abuse disorder across a wide range of\\nsubstances.\\nUnique to substance abuse is the fact that both genetic and familial influence are both at play. What\\ndoes this mean? Well, biologically, the individual may be genetically predisposed to substance abuse;\\nadditionally, the individual may also be at risk due to their familial environment where their parents or\\nsiblings are also engaging in substance abuse. Individuals whose parents abuse substances may have a\\ngreater opportunity to ingest substances, thus promoting drug-seeking behaviors. Furthermore, families\\nwith a history of substance abuse may have a more accepting attitude of drug use than families with no\\nhistory of substance abuse (Leventhal & Schmitz, 2006).\\n     11.4.1.2. Neurobiological. A longstanding belief about how drug abuse begins and is maintained\\nis the brain reward system. A reward can be defined as any event that increases the likelihood of a\\nresponse and has a pleasurable effect. Most of the research on the brain reward system has focused on\\nthe mesocorticolimbic dopamine system, as it appears this area is the primary reward system of most\\nsubstances that are abused. As research has evolved in the field of substance abuse, five additional\\nneurotransmitters have also been implicated in the reinforcing effect of addiction: dopamine, opioid\\npeptides, GABA, serotonin, and endocannabinoids. More specifically, dopamine is less involved in\\nopioid, alcohol, and cannabis. Alcohol and benzodiazepines lower the production of GABA, while cocaine\\nand amphetamines decrease dopamine. Cannabis has been shown to reduce the production of\\nendocannabinoids.\\n \\n11.4.2. Cognitive\\nCognitive theorists have focused on the beliefs regarding the anticipated effects of substance use.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n230\\nDefined as the expectancy effect, drug-seeking behavior is presumably motivated by the desire to attain\\na particular outcome by ingesting a substance. The expectancy effect can be defined in both positive\\nand negative forms. Positive expectations are thought to increase drug-seeking behavior, while negative\\nexperiences would decrease substance use (Oei & Morawska, 2004). Several studies have examined the\\nexpectancy effect on the use of alcohol. Those with alcohol abuse reported expectations of tension\\nreduction, enhanced sexual experiences, and improved social pleasure (Brown, 1985). Additionally,\\nobserving positive experiences, both in person and through television or social media, also shapes our\\ndrug use expectancies.\\nWhile some studies have explored the impact of negative expectancy to eliminate substance abuse,\\nresearch has failed to continually support this theory, suggesting that positive experiences and\\nexpectations are a more powerful motivator of substance abuse than the negative experiences (Jones,\\nCorbin, Fromme, 2001).\\n \\n11.4.3. Behavioral\\nOperant conditioning has been implicated in the role of developing substance use disorders. As you may\\nremember, operant conditioning refers to the increase or decrease of a behavior, due to reinforcement\\nor punishment. Since we are talking about increasing substance use, behavioral theorists suggest that\\nsubstance abuse is positively and negatively reinforced due to the effects of a substance.\\nPositive reinforcement occurs when substance use is increased due to the positive or pleasurable\\nexperiences of the substance. More specifically, the rewarding effect or pleasurable experiences while\\nunder the influence of various substances directly impacts the likelihood that the individual will use the\\nsubstance again. Studies of substance use on animals routinely support this theory as animals will work\\nto receive injections of various drugs (Wise & Koob, 2013).\\nNegative reinforcement, or the increase of a given behavior due to the removal of a negative effect, also\\nplays a role in substance abuse in two different ways. First, many people ingest a substance as an\\nescape from their unpleasant life—whether it be physical pain, stress, or anxiety, to name a few.\\nTherefore, the substance temporarily provides relief from a negative environment, thus reinforcing\\nfuture substance abuse (Wise & Koob, 2013). Secondly, negative reinforcement is involved in symptoms\\nof withdrawal. As previously mentioned, withdrawal from a substance often produces significant\\nnegative symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, uncontrollable shaking, etc. To eliminate these symptoms,\\nan individual will consume more of the substance, thus again escaping the negative symptoms and\\nenjoying the “highs” of the substance.    \\n \\n11.4.4. Sociocultural\\nArguably, one of the strongest influences of substance abuse is the impact of one’s friends and the\\nimmediate environment. Peer attitudes, perception of others’ drug use, pressure from peers to use\\nsubstances, and beliefs about substance use are among the strongest predictors of drug use patterns\\n(Leventhal & Schmitz, 2006). This is particularly concerning during adolescence when patterns of\\nsubstance use typically begin.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n231\\nAdditionally, research continually supports a strong relationship between second-generation substance\\nabusers (Wilens et al., 2014). The increased possibility of family members’ substance abuse is likely\\nrelated to both a genetic predisposition, as well as the accepting attitude of the familial environment\\n(Chung et al., 2014). Not only does a child have early exposure to these substances if their parent has a\\nsubstance abuse problem, but they are also less likely to have parental supervision, which may impact\\ntheir decision related to substance use (Wagner et al., 2010). One potential protective factor against\\nsubstance use is religiosity. More specifically, families that promote religiosity may reduce substance\\nuse by promoting negative experiences (Galen & Rogers, 2004).\\nAnother sociocultural view on substance abuse is stressful life events, particularly those related to\\nfinancial stability. Prevalence rates of substance abuse are higher among poorer people (SAMHSA,\\n2014). Furthermore, additional stressors such as childhood abuse and trauma, negative work\\nenvironments, as well as discrimination are also believed to contribute to the development of a\\nsubstance use disorder (Hurd, Varner, Caldwell, & Zimmerman, 2014; McCabe, Wilsnack, West, &\\nBoyd, 2010; Unger et al., 2014).\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nBiological causes of substance-related and addictive disorders include the brain reward system\\nand a genetic predisposition, though if the individual is not exposed to the substance they will not\\ndevelop the substance abuse.\\nCognitive causes of substance-related and addictive disorders include the expectancy effect, and\\nresearch provides stronger support for positive expectancy over negative expectancy.\\nBehavioral causes of substance-related and addictive disorders include positive and negative\\nreinforcement.\\nSociocultural causes of substance-related and addictive disorders include friends and the\\nimmediate environment.\\n \\nSection 11.4 Review Questions\\nDiscuss the brain reward system.

Overall, treatments for substance-related\\ndisorders are only mildly effective, likely due in large part to the addictive qualities in many of these\\nsubstances (Belendiuk & Riggs, 2014).\\n \\n11.5.1. Biological\\n     11.5.1.1. Detoxification. Detoxification refers to the medical supervision of withdrawal from a\\nspecified drug. While most detoxification programs are inpatient for increased monitoring, some\\nprograms allow for outpatient detoxification, particularly if the addiction is not as severe. There are two\\nmain theories of detoxification—gradually decreasing the amount of the substance until the individual is\\noff the drug completely, or eliminating the substance entirely while providing additional medications to\\nmanage withdrawal symptoms (Bisaga et al., 2015). Unfortunately, relapse rates are high for those\\nengaging in detoxification programs, particularly if they lack any follow-up psychological treatment.\\n     11.5.1.2. Agonist drugs. As researchers continue to learn more about both the mechanisms of\\nsubstances commonly abused, as well as the mechanisms in which the body processes these substances,\\nalternative medications are created to essentially replace the drug in which the individual is dependent\\non. These agonist drugs provide the individual with a “safe” drug that has a similar chemical make-up\\nto the addicted drug. One common example of this is methadone, an opiate agonist that is often used in\\nthe reduction of heroin use (Schwartz, Brooner, Montoya, Currens, & Hayes, 2010). Unfortunately,\\nbecause methadone reacts to the same neurotransmitter receptors as heroin, the individual essentially\\nreplaces their addiction to heroin with an addiction to methadone. While this is not ideal, methadone\\ntreatment is highly regulated under safe medical supervision. Furthermore, it is taken by mouth, thus\\neliminating the potential adverse effects of unsterilized needles in heroin use. While some argue that\\nmethadone maintenance programs are not an effective treatment because it simply replaces one drug\\nfor another, others claim that the combination of methadone with education and psychotherapy can\\nsuccessfully help individuals off both illicit drugs and methadone medications (Jhanjee, 2014).\\n     11.5.1.3. Antagonist drugs. Unlike agonist drugs, antagonist drugs block or change the effects\\nof the addictive drug. The most commonly prescribed antagonist drugs are Disulfiram and Naloxone.\\nDisulfiram is often given to individuals trying to abstain from alcohol as it produces significant negative\\neffects (i.e., nausea, vomiting, increased heart rate, and dizziness) when coupled with alcohol\\nconsumption. While this can be an effective treatment to eliminate alcohol use, the individual must be'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n233\\nmotivated to take the medication as prescribed (Diclemente et al., 2008).\\nSimilar to Disulfiram, Naloxone is used for individuals with opioid abuse. Naloxone acts by binding to\\nendorphin receptors, thus preventing the opioids from having the intended euphoric effect. In theory,\\nthis treatment appears promising, but it is extremely dangerous as it can send the individual into\\nimmediate, severe withdrawal symptoms (Alter, 2014). This type of treatment requires appropriate\\nmedical supervision to ensure the safety of the patient.\\n \\n11.5.2. Behavioral\\n     11.5.2.1. Aversion therapy. Based on respondent conditioning principles, aversion therapy is a\\nform of treatment for substance abuse that pairs the stimulus with some type of negative or aversive\\nstimulus. For example, an individual may be given a shock every time they think about or attempt to\\ndrink alcohol. By pairing this aversive stimulus to the abused substance, the individual will begin to\\nindependently pair the substance with an aversive thought, thus reducing their craving/desire for the\\nsubstance. Some view the use of agonist and antagonist drugs as a form of aversion therapy as these\\nmedications utilize the same treatment strategy as traditional aversion therapy.\\n     11.5.2.2. Contingency management. Contingency management is a treatment approach that\\nemphasizes operant conditioning—increasing sobriety and adherence to treatment programs through\\nrewards. Originally developed to increase adherence to medication and reinforce opiate abstinence in\\nmethadone patients, contingency management has been adapted to increase abstinence in many\\ndifferent substance abuse treatment programs. In general, patients are “rewarded” with vouchers or\\nprizes in exchange for abstinence from substance use (Hartzler, Lash, & Roll, 2012).  These vouchers\\nallow individuals to gain incentives specific to their interests, thus increasing the chances of abstinence.\\nCommon vouchers include movie tickets, sports equipment, or even cash (Mignon, 2014).\\nContingency management has been proven to be effective in treating various types of substance abuse,\\nparticularly alcohol and cocaine (Lewis & Petry, 2005). Not only has it been effective in reducing\\nsubstance use in addicts, but it has also been effective in increasing the amount of time patients remain\\nin treatment as well as compliance with the treatment program (Mignon, 2014). Despite its success,\\ndissemination of this type of treatment has been rare. To rectify this, the federal government has\\nprovided financial resources through SAMHSA for the development, implementation, and evaluation of\\ncontingency management as a treatment to reduce alcohol and drug use (Mignon, 2014).\\n \\n11.5.3. Cognitive-Behavioral\\n     11.5.3.1. Relapse prevention training. Relapse prevention training is essentially what it sounds\\nlike—identifying potentially high-risk situations for relapse and then learning behavioral skills and\\ncognitive interventions to prevent the occurrence of a relapse. Early in treatment, the clinician guides\\nthe patient to identify any interpersonal, intrapersonal, environmental, and physiological risks for\\nrelapse. Once these triggers are identified, the clinician works with the patient on cognitive and\\nbehavioral strategies such as learning effective coping strategies, enhancing self-efficacy, and\\nencouraging mastery of outcomes. Additionally, psychoeducation about how substance abuse is\\nmaintained, as well as identifying maladaptive thoughts and learning cognitive restructuring'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n234\\ntechniques, helps the patient make informed choices during high-risk situations. Finally, role-playing\\nthese high-risk situations in session allows patients to become comfortable engaging in these effective\\ncoping strategies that enhance their self-efficacy and ultimately reducing the chances of a relapse.\\nResearch for relapse prevention training appears to be somewhat effective for individuals with\\nsubstance-related disorders (Marlatt & Donovan, 2005).  \\n \\n11.5.4. Sociocultural\\n     11.5.4.1. Self-help. In 1935, two men suffering from alcohol abuse met and discussed their\\ntreatment options. Slowly, the group grew, and by 1946, this group was known as Alcoholics\\nAnonymous (AA). The two founders, along with other early members, developed the Twelve Step\\nTraditions to help guide members in spiritual and character development. Due to the popularity of the\\ntreatment program, other programs such as Narcotics Anonymous and Cocaine Anonymous, adopted\\nand adapted the Twelve Steps for their respective substance abuse. Similarly, Al-Anon and Alateen are\\ntwo support groups that offer support for families and teenagers of individuals struggling with alcohol\\nabuse.\\nThe overarching goal of AA is abstinence from alcohol. To achieve this, the participants are encouraged\\nto “take one day at a time.” In using the 12 steps, participants are emboldened to admit that they have a\\ndisease, that they are powerless over this disease, and that their disease is more powerful than any\\nperson. Therefore, participants turn their addiction over to God and ask for help to right their wrongs\\nand remove their negative character defects and shortcomings. The final steps include identifying and\\nmaking amends to those who they have wronged during their alcohol abuse.\\nWhile studies examining the effectiveness of AA programs are inconclusive, AA’s membership indicates\\nthat 27% of its members have been sober less than one year, 24% have been sober 1-5 years, 13% have\\nbeen sober 5-10 years, 14% have been sober 10-20 years, and more than 22% have been sober over 20\\nyears (Alcoholics Anonymous, 2014).  Some argue that this type of treatment is most effective for those\\nwho are willing and able to abstain from alcohol as opposed to those who can control their drinking to\\nmoderate levels.\\n     11.5.4.2. Residential treatment centers. Another type of treatment similar to self-help is\\nresidential treatment programs. In this placement, individuals are completely removed from their\\nenvironment and live, work, and socialize within a drug-free community while also attending regular\\nindividual, group, and family therapy. The types of treatment used within a residential program varies\\nfrom program to program, with most focusing on cognitive-behavioral and behavioral techniques.\\nSeveral also incorporate 12-step programs into treatment, as many patients transition from a residential\\ntreatment center to a 12-step program post discharge. As one would expect, the residential treatment\\ngoal is abstinence, and any evidence of substance abuse during the program is grounds for immediate\\ntermination.\\nStudies examining the effectiveness of residential treatment centers suggest that these programs are\\nuseful in treating a variety of substance abuse disorders; however, many of these programs are very\\ncostly, thus limiting the availability of this treatment to the general public (Bender, 2004; Galanter,\\n2014). Additionally, many individuals are not able to completely remove themselves from their daily\\nresponsibilities for several weeks to months, particularly those with families. Therefore, while this\\ntreatment option is very effective, it is also not an option for most individuals struggling with substance'),\n",

The goal for community reinforcement treatment is for\\npatients to abstain from substance use by replacing the positive reinforcements of the substance with\\nthat of sobriety. This is done through several different techniques such as motivational interviewing,\\nlearning adaptive coping strategies, and encouraging family support (Mignon, 2014). Essentially, the\\ncommunity around the patient reinforces the positive choices of abstaining from substance use.\\nCommunity reinforcement has been found to be effective in both an inpatient and outpatient setting\\n(Meyers & Squires, 2001). It is believed that the intrinsic motivation and the effective coping skills, in\\ncombination with the support of an individual’s immediate community (friends and family) is\\nresponsible for the long-term positive treatment effects of community reinforcement.\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nBiological treatment options for substance-related and addictive disorders include detoxification\\nprograms, agonist drugs, and antagonist drugs.\\nBehavioral treatment options for substance-related and addictive disorders include aversion\\ntherapy and contingency management.\\nCognitive-behavioral treatment options for substance-related and addictive disorders include\\nrelapse prevention training.\\nSociocultural treatment options for substance-related and addictive disorders include Alcoholics\\nAnonymous, residential treatment centers, and community reinforcement.\\n \\nSection 11.5 Review Questions\\nDiscuss the differences between agonist and antagonist drugs.

The Clinical Presentation of Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders\\nThe schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders are defined by one of the following main\\nsymptoms: delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking (speech), disorganized or abnormal motor\\nbehavior, and negative symptoms. Individuals diagnosed with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder\\nexperience psychosis, which is defined as a loss of contact with reality. Psychosis episodes make it\\ndifficult for individuals to perceive and respond to environmental stimuli, causing a significant\\ndisturbance in everyday functioning. While there are a vast number of symptoms displayed in\\nschizophrenia spectrum disorders, presentation of symptoms varies greatly among individuals, as there\\nare rarely two cases similar in presentation, triggers, course, or responsiveness to treatment.\\n     12.1.1.1. Delusions. Delusions are “fixed beliefs that are not amenable to change in light of\\nconflicting evidence” (APA, 2022, pp. 101). This means that despite evidence contradicting one’s\\nthoughts, the individual is unable to distinguish their thoughts from reality. The inability to identify\\nthoughts as delusional is likely likely due to a lack of insight. There are a wide range of  delusions that\\nare seen in the schizophrenia related disorders to include:\\nDelusions of grandeur– belief they have exceptional abilities, wealth, or fame; belief they are\\nGod or other religious saviors\\nDelusions of control– belief that others control their thoughts/feelings/actions\\nDelusions of thought broadcasting– belief that one’s thoughts are transparent and everyone\\nknows what they are thinking\\nDelusions of persecution– belief they are going to be harmed, harassed, plotted or\\ndiscriminated against by either an individual or an institution; it is the most common delusion\\n(Arango & Carpenter, 2010)\\nDelusions of reference– belief that specific gestures, comments, or even larger environmental\\ncues are directed directly to them\\nDelusions of thought withdrawal– belief that one’s thoughts have been removed by another\\nsource\\nIt is believed that the presentation of the delusion is primarily related to the social, emotional,\\neducational, and cultural background of the individual (Arango & Carpenter, 2010). For example, an\\nindividual with schizophrenia who comes from a highly religious family is more likely to experience\\nreligious delusions (delusions of grandeur) than another type of delusion.\\n     12.1.1.2. Hallucinations. Hallucinations are “perception-like experiences that occur without an\\nexternal stimulus” (APA, 2022, pg. 102). They can occur in any of the five senses: hearing (auditory\\nhallucinations), seeing (visual hallucinations), smelling (olfactory hallucinations), touching (tactile\\nhallucinations), and tasting (gustatory hallucinations). Additionally, they can occur in a single modality\\nor present across a combination of modalities (e.g., having auditory and visual hallucinations). For the\\nmost part, individuals recognize that their hallucinations are not real and attempt to engage in normal\\nbehavior while simultaneously combating ongoing hallucinations.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n240\\nAccording to various research studies, nearly half of all patients with schizophrenia report auditory\\nhallucinations, 15% report visual hallucinations, and 5% report tactile hallucinations (DeLeon, Cuesta,\\n& Peralta, 1993). Among the most common types of auditory hallucinations are voices talking to the\\npatient or various voices talking to one another. Generally, these hallucinations are not attributable to\\nany one person that the individual knows. They are usually clear, objective, and definite (Arango &\\nCarpenter, 2010). Additionally, the auditory hallucinations can be pleasurable, providing comfort to the\\npatient; however, in other individuals, the auditory hallucinations can be unsettling as they produce\\ncommands or malicious intent.\\n     12.1.1.3. Disorganized thinking (Speech). Among the most common cognitive impairments\\ndisplayed in patients with schizophrenia are disorganized thoughts, communication, and speech. More\\nspecifically, thoughts and speech patterns may appear to be circumstantial or tangential. For example,\\npatients may give unnecessary details in response to a question before they finally produce the desired\\nresponse. While the question is eventually answered in circumstantial speech patterns, in tangential\\nspeech patterns the patient never reaches the point. Another common cognitive symptom is speech\\nincoherence or word salad, where speech is “nearly incomprehensible and resembles receptive aphasia\\nin its linguistic disorganization” (APA, 2022, pg. 102). Derailment, or the illogical connection in a chain\\nof thoughts, is another common type of disorganized thinking. Although not always, derailment is often\\nseen in illogicality, or the tendency to provide bizarre explanations for things.\\nThese types of distorted thought patterns are often related to concrete thinking. That is, the individual\\nis focused on one aspect of a concept or thing and neglects all other aspects. This type of thinking\\nmakes treatment difficult as individuals lack insight into their illness and symptoms.\\n     12.1.1.4. Disorganized/abnormal motor behavior. These symptoms manifest as childlike\\n“silliness” to unpredictable agitation. Catatonic behavior, the decreased or complete lack of reactivity to\\nthe environment, is among the most commonly seen grossly disorganized motor behavior in\\nschizophrenia. There runs a range of catatonic behaviors from negativism (resistance to instruction);\\nmutism or stupor (complete lack of verbal and motor responses); rigidity (maintaining a rigid or upright\\nposture while resisting efforts to be moved); or posturing (holding odd, awkward postures for long\\nperiods). There is one type of catatonic behavior, catatonic excitement, where the individual\\nexperiences hyperactivity of motor behavior, in a seemingly excited or delirious way. Other features\\ninclude repeated stereotyped movements, staring, grimacing, and the echoing of speech (APA, 2022, pg.\\n102).\\n     12.1.1.5. Negative symptoms. Up until this point, all the symptoms can be categorized as positive\\nsymptoms, or symptoms that are an over-exaggeration of normal brain processes; these symptoms are\\nalso new to the individual. The final diagnostic criterion is negative symptoms, which are defined as\\nthe inability or decreased ability to initiate actions, speech, express emotion, or feel pleasure (Barch,\\n2013). Negative symptoms often present before positive symptoms and remain once positive symptoms\\nremit. Because of their prevalence through the course of the disorder, they are also more indicative of\\nprognosis, with more negative symptoms suggesting a poorer prognosis. The poorer prognosis may be\\nexplained by the lack of effectiveness antipsychotic medications have in addressing negative symptoms\\n(Kirkpatrick, Fenton, Carpenter, & Marder, 2006). There are six main types of negative symptoms seen\\nin patients with schizophrenia. Such symptoms include:\\nDiminished emotional expression – Reduction in emotional expression; reduced display of\\nemotional expression'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n241\\nAlogia – Poverty of speech or speech content\\nAnhedonia – Inability to experience pleasure\\nAsociality – Lack of interest in social relationships\\nAvolition – Lack of motivation for goal-directed behavior\\n \\n12.1.2. Schizophrenia\\nAs stated above, the hallmark symptoms of schizophrenia include the presentation of at least two of\\nthe following during a one month period: delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech,\\ndisorganized/abnormal behavior, or negative symptoms. These symptoms create significant impairment\\nin an individual’s ability to engage in normal daily functioning such as work, school, relationships with\\nothers, or self-care, and continuous signs of the disturbance persist for at least 6 months. It should be\\nnoted that the presentation of schizophrenia varies significantly among individuals, as it is a\\nheterogeneous clinical syndrome (APA, 2022).\\nWhile the presence of symptoms must persist for a minimum of 6 months to meet the criteria for a\\nschizophrenia diagnosis, it is not uncommon to have prodromal symptoms that precede the active\\nphase of the disorder and residual symptoms that follow it. These prodromal and residual symptoms\\nare “subthreshold” forms of psychotic symptoms that do not cause significant impairment in\\nfunctioning, with the exception of negative symptoms (Lieberman et al., 2001). Due to the severity of\\npsychotic symptoms, mood disorder symptoms are also common among individuals with schizophrenia;\\nhowever, these mood symptoms are distinct from a mood disorder diagnosis in that psychotic features\\nwill exist beyond the remission of depressive symptoms.\\n \\n12.1.3. Schizophreniform Disorder\\nSchizophreniform disorder is similar to schizophrenia, except for the length of presentation of\\nsymptoms. Schizophreniform disorder is considered an “intermediate” disorder between schizophrenia\\nand brief psychotic disorder as the symptoms are present for at least one month but not longer than six\\nmonths. Schizophrenia symptoms must be present for at least six months and a brief psychotic disorder\\nis diagnosed when symptoms are present for less than one month. Approximately two-thirds of\\nindividuals who are initially diagnosed with schizophreniform disorder will have symptoms that last\\nlonger than six months, at which time their diagnosis is changed to schizophrenia (APA, 2022).\\nAnother key distinguishing feature of schizophreniform disorder is the lack of criteria related to\\nimpaired functioning. While many individuals with schizophreniform disorder do display impaired\\nfunctioning, it is not essential for diagnosis. Finally, any major mood episodes—either depressive or\\nmanic— that are present concurrently with the psychotic features must only be present for a short time,\\notherwise a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder may be more appropriate (APA, 2022).\\n \\nMaking Sense of the Disorders'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n242\\nIn relation to schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders, note the following:\\nDiagnosis brief psychotic disorder …… if symptoms have been present for less than one month\\nDiagnosis schizophreniform disorder …… if symptoms have been present for at least one month\\nbut not longer than six months\\nDiagnosis schizophrenia … if the symptoms have been present for at least six months\\n \\n12.1.4. Schizoaffective Disorder\\nSchizoaffective disorder is characterized by the psychotic symptoms included in schizophrenia and a\\nconcurrent uninterrupted period of a major mood episode—either a major depressive or manic episode.\\nIt should be noted that because the loss of interest in pleasurable activities is a common symptom of\\nschizophrenia, to meet the criteria for a depressive episode within schizoaffective disorder, the\\nindividual must present with a pervasive depressed mood (APA, 2022). While schizophrenia and\\nschizophreniform disorder do not have a significant mood component, schizoaffective disorder requires\\nthe presence of a depressive or manic episode for the majority, if not the total duration of the disorder.\\nWhile psychotic symptoms are sometimes present in depressive episodes, they often remit once the\\ndepressive episode is resolved. For individuals with schizoaffective disorder, psychotic symptoms should\\ncontinue for at least two weeks in the absence of a major mood disorder (APA, 2022). This is the key\\ndistinguishing feature between schizoaffective disorder and major depressive disorder with psychotic\\nfeatures.\\n \\n12.1.5. Delusional Disorder\\nAs suggestive of its title, delusional disorder requires the presence of at least one delusion that lasts\\nfor at least one month in duration. It is important to note that if an individual experiences\\nhallucinations, disorganized speech, disorganized or catatonic behavior, or negative symptoms—in\\naddition to delusions—they should not be diagnosed with delusional disorder as their symptoms are\\nmore aligned with a schizophrenia diagnosis. Unlike most other schizophrenia-related disorders, daily\\nfunctioning is not overly impacted due to the delusions. Additionally, if symptoms of depressive or\\nmanic episodes present during delusions, they are typically brief compared to the duration of the\\ndelusions.\\nThe DSM-V-TR (APA, 2022) has identified five main subtypes of delusional disorder to better categorize\\nthe symptoms of the individual’s disorder. When making a diagnosis of delusional disorder, one of the\\nfollowing modifiers (in addition to mixed presentation) is included. Erotomanic delusion occurs when\\nan individual reports a delusion of another person being in love with them. Generally speaking, the\\nindividual whom the convictions are about is of higher status, such as a celebrity. Grandiose delusion\\ninvolves the conviction of having great talent or insight. Occasionally, patients will report they have\\nmade an important discovery that benefits the general public. Grandiose delusions may also take on\\nreligious affiliation, as people believe they are prophets or even God. Jealous delusion revolves around\\nthe conviction that one’s spouse or partner is/has been unfaithful. While many individuals may have this\\nsuspicion at some point in their relationship, a jealous delusion is much more extensive and generally\\nbased on incorrect inferences that lack evidence. Persecutory delusion involves the individual'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n243\\nbelieving that they are being conspired against, spied on, followed, poisoned or drugged, maliciously\\nmaligned, harassed, or obstructed in pursuit of their long-term goals (APA, 2022). Of all subtypes of\\ndelusional disorder, those experiencing persecutory delusions are the most at risk of becoming\\naggressive or hostile, likely due to the persecutory nature of their distorted beliefs. Finally, somatic\\ndelusion involves delusions regarding bodily functions or sensations. While these delusions can vary\\nsignificantly, the most common beliefs are that the individual emits a foul odor despite attempts to\\nrectify the smell; there is an infestation of insects on the skin; or that they have an internal parasite\\n(APA, 2022). If no one delusion predominates, the mixed type specifier is used and if the dominant\\ndelusional belief cannot be clearly determined, use the unspecified type specifier. A separate specifier\\nis used when the content of the  delusions are deemed bizarre or implausible, not understandable, and\\nnot derived from ordinary life experience.\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nSchizophrenia spectrum disorders are characterized by delusions, hallucinations, disorganized\\nthinking (speech), disorganized or abnormal motor behavior, and negative symptoms.\\nDelusions are beliefs that do not change even when conflicting evidence is presented and can be\\nof grandeur, control, thought broadcasting, persecution, reference, and thought withdrawal.\\nHallucinations occur in any sense modality and most individuals recognize that they are not real.\\nDisorganized thinking, abnormal motor behavior, catatonic behavior, and negative symptoms such\\nas affective flattening, alogia, anhedonia, asociality, and avolition are also common to\\nschizophrenia spectrum disorders.\\nSchizophrenia is characterized by delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech,\\ndisorganized/abnormal behavior, or negative symptoms lasting six months.\\nSchizophreniform disorder is considered an “intermediate” disorder between schizophrenia and\\nbrief psychotic disorder as the symptoms are present for at least one month but not longer than\\nsix months.\\nSchizoaffective disorder is characterized by the psychotic symptoms included in schizophrenia\\nand a concurrent uninterrupted period of a major mood episode—either a depressive or manic\\nepisode.\\nDelusional disorder requires the presence of at least one delusion that lasts for at least one month\\nin duration to include erotomanic, grandiose, jealous, persecutory, and somatic.\\n \\nSection 12.1 Review Questions\\nWhat are the four positive symptoms identified in a schizophrenia diagnosis?

There is some\\ndiscrepancy in rates of diagnosis between genders; these differences appear to be related to the\\nemphasis of various symptoms. For example, men typically present with more negative symptoms,\\nwhereas women present with more affect-laden symptoms. Despite gender differences in the\\npresentation of symptoms, there appears to be an equal risk for both genders to develop the disorder.\\nSchizophrenia typically occurs between late teens and mid-30s, with the onset of the disorder slightly\\nearlier for males than females (APA, 2022). Earlier onset of the disorder is generally predictive of a\\nworse overall prognosis. Onset of symptoms is typically gradual, with initial symptoms presenting\\nsimilarly to depressive disorders; however, some individuals will present with an abrupt presentation of\\nthe disorder. Negative symptoms appear to be more predictive of prognosis than other symptoms. This\\nmay be due to negative symptoms being the most persistent, and therefore, most difficult to treat.\\nOverall, an estimated 13.5% of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia meet recovery criteria,\\naccording to one meta-analysis of 50 studies of individuals with broadly defined schizophrenia (APA,\\n2022).\\nSchizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform disorder, and delusional disorder prevalence rates are all\\nsignificantly less than that of schizophrenia, occurring in 0.2% to 0.3% of the general population.

Additionally, there appears to be comorbidity with\\nanxiety-related disorders, specifically panic disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder, among\\nindividuals with schizophrenia than compared to the general public.

Biological\\n     12.4.1.1. Genetic/Family studies. Twin and family studies consistently support the biological\\ntheory. More specifically, if one identical twin develops schizophrenia, there is a 48% chance that the\\nother will also develop the disorder within their lifetime (Coon & Mitter, 2007). This percentage drops\\nto 17% in fraternal twins. Similarly, family studies have also found similarities in brain abnormalities\\namong individuals with schizophrenia and their relatives; the more similarities, the higher the likelihood\\nthat the family member also developed schizophrenia (Scognamiglio & Houenou, 2014).\\n     12.4.1.2. Neurobiological. There is consistent and reliable evidence of a neurobiological\\ncomponent in the transmission of schizophrenia. More specifically, neuroimaging studies have found a\\nsignificant reduction in overall and specific brain region volumes, as well as tissue density of individuals\\nwith schizophrenia compared to healthy controls (Brugger, & Howes, 2017). Additionally, there has\\nbeen evidence of ventricle enlargement as well as volume reductions in the medial temporal lobe. As\\nyou may recall, structures such as the amygdala (involved in emotion regulation), the hippocampus\\n(involved in memory), as well as the neocortical surface of the temporal lobes (processing of auditory'),\n",

Additional studies also\\nindicate a reduction in the orbitofrontal regions of the brain, a part of the frontal lobe that is\\nresponsible for response inhibition (Kurtz, 2015).\\n     12.4.1.3. Stress cascade. The stress-vulnerability model suggests that individuals have a genetic\\nor biological predisposition to develop the disorder; however, symptoms will not present unless there is\\na stressful precipitating factor that elicits the onset of the disorder. Researchers have identified the\\nHPA axis and its consequential neurological effects as the likely responsible neurobiological component\\nresponsible for this stress cascade.\\nThe HPA axis is one of the main neurobiological structures that mediate stress. It involves the\\nregulation of three chemical messengers (corticotropin-releasing hormone [CRH], adrenocorticotropic\\nhormone [ACTH], and glucocorticoids) as they respond to a stressful situation (Corcoran et al., 2003).\\nGlucocorticoids, more commonly referred to as cortisol, is the final neurotransmitter released which is\\nresponsible for the physiological change that accompanies stress to prepare the body to “fight” or\\n“flight.”\\nIt is hypothesized that in combination with abnormal brain structures, persistently increased levels of\\nglucocorticoids in brain structures may be the key to the onset of psychosis in prodromal patients\\n(Corcoran et al., 2003). More specifically, stress exposure (and increased glucocorticoids) affects the\\nneurotransmitter system and exacerbates psychotic symptoms due to changes in dopamine activity\\n(Walker & Diforio, 1997). While research continues to explore the relationship between stress and onset\\nof the disorder, evidence for the implication of stress and symptom relapse is strong. More specifically,\\nschizophrenia patients experience more stressful life events leading up to a relapse of symptoms.\\nSimilarly, it is hypothesized that the worsening or exacerbation of symptoms is also a source of stress as\\nthey interfere with daily functioning (Walker & Diforio, 1997). This stress alone may be enough to\\ninitiate the onset of a relapse.\\n \\n12.4.2. Psychological\\n     12.4.2.1. Cognitive. The cognitive model utilizes some of the aspects of the diathesis-stress model\\nin that it proposes that premorbid neurocognitive impairment places individuals at risk for aversive\\nwork/academic/interpersonal experiences. These experiences, in turn, lead to dysfunctional beliefs and\\ncognitive appraisals, ultimately leading to maladaptive behaviors such as delusions/hallucinations (Beck\\n& Rector, 2005). Beck proposed the following diathesis-stress model for how schizophrenia develops\\n(Fee Figure 12.1).\\n \\nFigure 12.1. Diathesis-Stress Model of the Development of Schizophrenia'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n248\\n Adapted from Beck & Rector, 2005, pg. 580\\n \\nBased on this theory, an underlying neurocognitive impairment (as discussed above) makes an\\nindividual more vulnerable to experience aversive life events such as homelessness, conflict within the\\nfamily, etc. Individuals with schizophrenia are more likely to evaluate these aversive life events with a\\ndysfunctional attitude and maladaptive cognitive distortions. The combination of the aversive events\\nand negative interpretations produces a stress response in the individual, thus igniting hyperactivation\\nof the HPA axis. According to Beck and Rector (2005), it is the culmination of these events leads to the\\ndevelopment of schizophrenia.\\n \\n12.4.3. Sociocultural\\n     12.4.3.1. Expressed emotion. Research regarding supportive family environments suggests that\\nfamilies high in expressed emotion, meaning families that have high hostile, critical, or overinvolved\\nfamily members, are predictors of relapse (Bebbington & Kuipers, 2011). In fact, individuals who return\\npost-hospitalization to families with high criticism and emotional involvement are twice as likely to\\nrelapse compared to those who return to families with low expressed emotion (Corcoran et al., 2003).\\nSeveral meta-analyses have concluded that family atmosphere is causally related to relapse in patients\\nwith schizophrenia, and that these outcomes can be improved when the family environment is improved\\n(Bebbington & Kuipers, 2011). Therefore, one major treatment goal in families of patients with\\nschizophrenia is to reduce expressed emotion within family interactions.\\n     12.4.3.2. Family dysfunction.

Although more recent advancements\\nin treatment for schizophrenia appear promising, the disease itself is still viewed as one that requires\\nlifelong treatment and care.\\n \\n12.5.1. Psychopharmacological\\nAmong the first antipsychotic medications used for the treatment of schizophrenia was Thorazine.\\nDeveloped as a derivative of antihistamines, Thorazine was the first line of treatment that produced a\\ncalming effect on even the most severely agitated patients and allowed for the organization of thoughts.\\nDespite their effectiveness in managing psychotic symptoms, conventional antipsychotics (such as\\nThorazine and Chlorpromazine) also produced significant  side effects similar to that of neurological\\ndisorders. Therefore, psychotic symptoms were replaced with muscle tremors, involuntary movements,\\nand muscle rigidity. Additionally, these conventional antipsychotics also produced tardive dyskinesia\\nin patients, which included involuntary movements isolated to the tongue, mouth, and face (Tenback et\\nal., 2006). While only 10% of patients reported the development of tardive dyskinesia, this percentage\\nincreased the longer patients were on the medication, as well as the higher the dose (Achalia,\\nChaturvedi, Desai, Rao, & Prakash, 2014). In efforts to avoid these symptoms, clinicians have been\\ncognizant of not exceeding the clinically effective dose of conventional antipsychotic medications. If the\\nmanagement of psychotic symptoms cannot be resolved at this level, alternative medications are often\\nadded to produce a synergistic effect (Roh et al., 2014).\\nDue to the harsh side effects of conventional antipsychotic drugs, newer, arguably more effective\\nsecond-generation or atypical antipsychotic drugs have been developed. The atypical antipsychotic\\ndrugs appear to act on both dopamine and serotonin receptors, as opposed to only dopamine receptors\\nin the conventional antipsychotics. Because of this, common medications such as clozapine (Clozaril),\\nrisperidone (Risperdal), and aripiprazole (Abilify), appear to be more effective in managing both positive\\nand negative symptoms. While there continues to be a risk of developing side effects such as tardive\\ndyskinesia, recent studies suggest it is much lower than that of the conventional antipsychotics (Leucht,\\nHeres, Kissling, & Davis, 2011). Thus, due to their effectiveness and minimal side effects, atypical\\nantipsychotic medications are typically the first line of treatment for schizophrenia (Barnes & Marder,\\n2011).\\nIt should be noted that because of the harsh side effects of antipsychotic medications in general, many\\nindividuals, nearly one half to three-quarters of patients, discontinue the use of antipsychotic drugs\\n(Leucht, Heres, Kissling, & Davis, 2011). Because of this, it is also important to incorporate\\npsychological interventions along with psychopharmacological treatment to both address medication\\nadherence, as well as provide additional support for symptom management.\\n \\n12.5.2. Psychological Interventions\\n     12.5.2.1. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). As discussed in previous chapters, the goal of\\ntreatment is to identify the negative biases and attributions that influence an individual’s\\ninterpretations of events and the subsequent consequences of these thoughts and behaviors. For'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n251\\nschizophrenia, CBT focuses on the maladaptive emotional and behavioral responses to psychotic\\nexperiences, which is directly related to distress and disability. Therefore, the goal of CBT is not on\\nsymptom reduction, but rather to improve the interpretations and understandings of these symptoms\\n(and experiences) which will reduce associated distress (Kurtz, 2015). Common features of CBT for\\nschizophrenia patients include psychoeducation about their disease and the course of their symptoms\\n(i.e., ways to identify coming and going of delusions/hallucinations), challenging and replacing the\\nnegative thoughts/behaviors associated with their delusions/hallucinations to more positive\\nthoughts/behaviors, and finally, learning positive coping strategies to deal with their unpleasant\\nsymptoms (Veiga-Martinez, Perez-Alvarez, & Garcia-Montes, 2008).\\nFindings from studies exploring CBT as a supportive treatment have been promising. One study\\nconducted by Aaron Beck (the founder of CBT) and colleagues (Grant, Huh, Perivoliotis, Stolar, & Beck,\\n2011) found that recovery-oriented CBT produced a marked improvement in overall functioning as well\\nas symptom reduction in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. This study suggests that by focusing on\\ntargeted goals such as independent living, securing employment, and improving social relationships,\\npatients were able to slowly move closer to these targeted goals. By also including a variety of CBT\\nstrategies such as role-playing, scheduling community outings, and addressing negative cognitions,\\nindividuals were also able to address cognitive and social skill deficits.\\n \\n12.5.3. Family Interventions\\nThe diathesis-stress model of schizophrenia has primarily influenced family interventions. As previously\\ndiscussed, the emergence of the disorder and exacerbation of symptoms is likely related to\\nenvironmental stressors and psychological factors. While the degree in which environmental stress\\nstimulates an exacerbation of symptoms varies among individuals, there is significant evidence to\\nconclude that stress does impact illness presentation (Haddock & Spaulding, 2011). Therefore, the\\noverall goal of family interventions is to reduce the stress on the individual that is likely to elicit the\\nonset of symptoms.\\nUnlike many other psychological interventions, there is not a specific outline for family-based\\ninterventions related to schizophrenia. However, the majority of programs include the following\\ncomponents: psychoeducation, problem-solving skills, and cognitive-behavioral therapy.\\nPsychoeducation is important for both the patient and family members as it is reported that more than\\nhalf of those recovering from a psychotic episode reside with their family (Haddock & Spaulding, 2011).\\nTherefore, educating families on the course of the illness, as well as ways to recognize onset of\\npsychotic symptoms, is important to ensure optimal recovery.\\nProblem-solving is a crucial component in the family intervention model. Seeing as family conflict can\\nincrease stress within the home, which in return can lead to worsening of psychotic symptoms, family\\nmembers benefit from learning effective methods of problem-solving to address family conflicts.\\nAdditionally, teaching positive coping strategies for dealing with the symptoms of mental illness and its\\ndirect effect on the family environment may also alleviate some friction within the home\\nThe third component, CBT, is similar to that described above. The goal of family-based CBT is to reduce\\nnegativity among family member interactions, as well as help family members adjust to living with\\nsomeone with psychotic symptoms. These three components within the family intervention program'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n252\\nhave been shown to reduce re-hospitalization rates, as well as slow the worsening of schizophrenia-\\nrelated symptoms (Pitschel-Walz, Leucht, Baumi, Kissling, & Engel, 2001).\\n     12.5.3.1. Social skills training. Given the poor interpersonal functioning among individuals with\\nschizophrenia, social skills training is another type of treatment commonly suggested to improve\\npsychosocial functioning. Research has indicated that poor interpersonal skills not only predate the\\nonset of the disorder but also remain significant even with the management of symptoms via\\nantipsychotic medications. Impaired ability to interact with individuals in a social, occupational, or\\nrecreational setting is related to poorer psychological adjustment (Bellack, Morrison, Wixted, &\\nMueser, 1990). This can lead to greater isolation and reduced social support among individuals with\\nschizophrenia. As previously discussed, social support has been identified as a protective factor of\\nsymptom exacerbation, as it buffers psychosocial stressors that are often responsible for the\\nexacerbation of symptoms. Learning how to interact with others appropriately (e.g., establish eye\\ncontact, engage in reciprocal conversations, etc.) through role-play in a group therapy setting is one\\neffective way to teach positive social skills.\\n     12.5.3.2. Inpatient Hospitalizations. More commonly viewed as community-based treatments,\\ninpatient hospitalization programs are essential in stabilizing patients in psychotic episodes. Generally\\nspeaking, patients will be treated on an outpatient basis; however, there are times when their symptoms\\nexceed the needs of an outpatient service. Short-term hospitalizations are used to modify antipsychotic\\nmedications and implement additional psychological treatments so that a patient can safely return to\\ntheir home. These hospitalizations generally last for a few weeks as opposed to a long-term treatment\\noption that would last months or years (Craig & Power, 2010).\\nIn addition to short-term hospitalizations, there are also partial hospitalizations where an individual\\nenrolls in a full-day program but returns home for the evening. These programs provide individuals with\\nintensive therapy, organized activities, and group therapy programs that enhance social skills training.\\nResearch supports the use of partial hospitalizations as individuals enrolled in these programs tend to\\ndo better than those who enter outpatient care (Bales et al., 2014).\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nPsychopharmacological treatment options for schizophrenia spectrum disorders include\\nantipsychotic drugs such as Thorazine, Chlorpromazine, Clozaril, Risperdal, and Abilify.\\nPsychological treatment options for schizophrenia spectrum disorders include CBT, the goal of\\nwhich is to improve the interpretations and understandings of symptoms (and experiences) which\\nwill reduce associated distress.\\nFamily interventions for schizophrenia spectrum disorders include psychoeducation, problem-\\nsolving skills, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), social skills training, and inpatient/partial\\nhospitalizations.\\n \\nSection 12.5 Review Questions'),\n",

Overview of Personality Disorders\\nAccording to the DSM-5-TR, personality traits are “…enduring patterns of perceiving, relating to, and\\nthinking about the environment and oneself that are exhibited in a wide range of social and personality\\ncontexts while a personality disorder “…is an enduring pattern of inner experience and behavior that\\ndeviates markedly from the norms and expectations of the individual’s culture, is pervasive and\\ninflexible, and has an onset in adolescence or early adulthood, is stable over time, and leads to distress\\nor impairment” (APA, 2022, pg. 733). Personality disorders have four defining features, which include\\ndistorted thinking patterns, problematic emotional responses, over- or under-regulated impulse control,\\nand interpersonal difficulties. While these four core features are universal among all ten personality\\ndisorders, the DSM-5-TR divides the personality disorders into three different clusters based on\\nsymptom similarities.\\nCluster A is described as the odd or eccentric cluster and consists of paranoid, schizoid, and\\nschizotypal personality disorders. The common feature between these three disorders is social\\nawkwardness and social withdrawal. Often these behaviors are similar to those seen in schizophrenia;\\nhowever, they tend to be not as extensive or impactful on daily functioning as seen in schizophrenia. In\\nfact, there is a strong relationship between Cluster A personality disorders among individuals who have\\na relative diagnosed with schizophrenia (Chemerinksi & Siever, 2011).\\nCluster B is the dramatic, emotional, or erratic cluster and consists of antisocial, borderline, histrionic,\\nand narcissistic personality disorders. Individuals with these personality disorders often experience\\nproblems with impulse control and emotional regulation. Due to the dramatic, emotional, and erratic\\nnature of these disorders, it is nearly impossible for individuals to establish healthy relationships with\\nothers.\\nAnd finally, Cluster C is the anxious or fearful cluster and consists of avoidant, dependent, and\\nobsessive-compulsive personality disorders. As you read through the descriptions of the disorders, you\\nwill see an overlap with symptoms from the anxiety and depressive disorders. Cluster C disorders have\\nthe most treatment options of all the personality disorders, likely because the overlapping anxiety and\\ndepressive disorders have well-established treatment options.\\nTo meet the criteria for any personality disorder, the individual must display the pattern of behaviors in'),\n",

Some children may present with\\nsimilar symptoms, such as poor peer relationships, odd or eccentric behaviors, or peculiar thoughts and\\nlanguage; however, a formal personality disorder diagnosis cannot be made until the age of 18. The\\nDSM-5-TR reports that median prevalence across several countries is 3.6% for Cluster A disorders,\\n4.5% for Cluster B, 2.8% for Cluster C, and 10.5% for any personality disorder.\\nIt is also noted that the clustering approach used in the DSM has not been consistently validated and\\nhas some serious limitations. As written, “An alternative to the categorical approach is the dimensional\\nperspective that personality disorders represent maladaptive variants of personality traits that merge\\nimperceptibly into normality and into one another” (APA, 2022, pg. 734). Interested readers should\\nconsult Section III of the DSM (beginning on page 881) for a full description of the dimensional model\\nfor personality disorders and an alternative model for personality disorders that utilizes a hybrid\\ndimensional-categorical model approach.\\n \\n13.1.2. Cluster A\\n     13.1.2.1. Paranoid personality disorder. Paranoid personality disorder is characterized by a\\nmarked distrust or suspicion of others. Individuals interpret and believe that other’s motives and\\ninteractions are intended to harm them, and therefore, they are skeptical about establishing close\\nrelationships outside of family members—although, at times, even family members’ actions are also\\nbelieved to be malevolent (APA, 2022). Individuals with paranoid personality disorder often feel as\\nthough they have been deeply and irreversibly hurt by others even though they lack evidence to support\\nthat these others intended to or did hurt them. Because of these persistent suspicions, they will doubt\\nrelationships that show true loyalty or trustworthiness. Compliments are misinterpreted and they may\\nview an offer of help as a criticism that they are not doing a good enough job on their own.\\nIndividuals with paranoid personality disorder are also hesitant to share any personal information or\\nconfide in others as they fear the information will be used against them. Additionally, benign remarks or\\nevents are often viewed as demeaning or threatening. For example, if an individual with paranoid\\npersonality disorder was accidentally bumped into at the store, they would interpret this action as\\nintentional, with the purpose of causing them injury. Because of this, individuals with paranoid\\npersonality disorder are quick to hold grudges and unwilling to forgive insults or injuries- whether\\nintentional or not. They are known to quickly and angrily counterattack, either verbally or physically, in\\nsituations where they feel they were insulted (APA, 2022).\\n     13.1.2.2. Schizoid personality disorder. Individuals with schizoid personality disorder display\\na persistent pattern of avoidance of social relationships, along with a limited range of emotional\\nexpression in interpersonal settings (APA, 2022). Similar to those with paranoid personality disorder,\\nindividuals with schizoid personality disorder do not have many close relationships; however, unlike\\nparanoid personality disorder, this lack of connection is not due to suspicious feelings, but rather, the\\nlack of desire to engage with others and the preference to engage in solitary behaviors. Individuals with\\nschizoid personality disorder are often viewed as “loners” and prefer activities where they do not have\\nto engage with others (APA, 2022). Established relationships rarely extend outside that of the family as\\nthey make no effort to start or maintain friendships. This lack of establishing social relationships also\\nextends to sexual behaviors, as these individuals report a lack of interest in engaging in sexual\\nexperiences with others.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n257\\nRegarding the limited range of emotion, individuals with schizoid personality disorder are often\\nindifferent to criticisms or praises of others and appear not to be affected by what others think of them.\\nIndividuals will rarely show any feelings or expressions of emotion and are often described as having a\\n“bland” exterior (APA, 2022). In fact, individuals with schizoid personality disorder rarely reciprocate\\nfacial expressions or gestures typically displayed in normal conversations such as smiles or nods.\\nBecause of this lack of emotion, there is a limited need for attention or acceptance.\\n     13.1.2.3. Schizotypal personality disorder. Schizotypal personality disorder is characterized\\nby a range of impairment in social and interpersonal relationships due to discomfort in relationships,\\nalong with odd cognitive or perceptual distortions and eccentric behaviors (APA, 2022). Similar to those\\nwith schizoid personality disorder, individuals also seek isolation and have few, if any established\\nrelationships outside of family members.\\nOne of the most prominent features of schizotypal personality disorder is ideas of reference, or the\\nbelief that unrelated events pertain to them in a particular and unusual way. Ideas of reference also\\nlead to superstitious behaviors or preoccupation with paranormal activities that are not generally\\naccepted in their culture (APA, 2022). The perception of special or magical powers, such as the ability\\nto mind-read or control other’s thoughts, has also been documented in individuals with schizotypal\\npersonality disorder. Similar to schizophrenia, unusual perceptual experiences such as auditory\\nhallucinations, as well as unusual speech patterns of derailment or incoherence, are also present.\\nLike the other personality disorders within cluster A, there is a component of paranoia or\\nsuspiciousness of other’s motives. Additionally, individuals with schizotypal personality disorder display\\ninappropriate or restricted affect, thus impacting their ability to appropriately interact with others in a\\nsocial context. Significant social anxiety is often also present in social situations, particularly in those\\ninvolving unfamiliar people. The combination of limited affect and social anxiety contributes to their\\ninability to establish and maintain personal relationships; most individuals with schizotypal personality\\ndisorder prefer to keep to themselves to reduce this anxiety.\\n \\n13.1.3. Cluster B\\n     13.1.3.1. Antisocial personality disorder. The essential feature of antisocial personality\\ndisorder is the persistent pattern of disregard for, and violation of, the rights of others. This pattern of\\nbehavior begins in late childhood or early adolescence and continues throughout adulthood. While this\\nbehavior presents before age 15, the individual cannot be diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder\\nuntil the age of 18. Prior to age 18, the individual would be diagnosed with conduct disorder. Although\\nnot discussed in this book as it is a disorder of childhood, conduct disorder involves a repetitive and\\npersistent pattern of behaviors that violate the rights of others or major age-appropriate norms.\\nCommon behaviors of individuals with conduct disorder that go on to develop antisocial personality\\ndisorder are aggression toward people or animals, destruction of property, deceitfulness or theft, or\\nserious violation of rules (APA, 2022).\\nWhile commonly referred to as “psychopaths” or “sociopaths,” individuals with antisocial personality\\ndisorder fail to conform to social norms. This also includes legal rules as individuals with antisocial\\npersonality disorder are often repeatedly arrested for property destruction, harassing/assaulting others,\\nor stealing (APA, 2022). Deceitfulness is another hallmark symptom of antisocial personality disorder as\\nindividuals often lie repeatedly, generally to gain profit or pleasure. There is also a pattern of'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n258\\nimpulsivity—decisions made in the moment without forethought of personal consequences or\\nconsideration for others (Lang et al., 2015). This impulsivity also contributes to their inability to hold\\njobs as they are more likely to impulsively quit their jobs (Hengartner et al., 2014). Employment\\ninstability, along with impulsivity, also impacts their ability to manage finances; it is not uncommon to\\nsee individuals with antisocial personality disorder with large debts that they are unable to pay\\n(Derefinko & Widiger, 2016).\\nWhile also likely related to impulsivity, individuals with antisocial personality disorder tend to be\\nextremely irritable and aggressive, repeatedly getting into fights. The marked disregard for their safety,\\nas well as the safety of others, is also observed in reckless behavior such as speeding, driving under the\\ninfluence, and engaging in sexual and substance abuse behavior that may put themselves at risk (APA,\\n2022).\\nOf course, the most known and devastating symptom of antisocial personality disorder is the lack of\\nremorse for the consequences of their actions, regardless of how severe they may be. Individuals often\\nrationalize their actions as the fault of the victim, minimize the harmfulness of the consequences of\\ntheir behaviors, or display indifference (APA, 2022). Overall, individuals with antisocial personality\\ndisorder have limited personal relationships due to their selfish desire and lack of moral conscience.\\n     13.1.3.2. Borderline personality disorder. Individuals with borderline personality disorder\\ndisplay a pervasive pattern of instability in interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affect (APA,\\n2022). The combination of these symptoms causes significant impairment in establishing and\\nmaintaining personal relationships. They will often go to great lengths to avoid real or imagined\\nabandonment. Fears related to abandonment can lead to inappropriate anger as they often interpret the\\nabandonment as a reflection of their own behavior. It is not uncommon to experience intense\\nfluctuations in mood, often observed as volatile interactions with family and friends (Herpertz &\\nBertsch, 2014).  Those with borderline personality disorder may be friendly one day and hostile the\\nnext.\\nTo prevent abandonment, individuals with borderline personality disorder will often exhibit impulsive\\nbehaviors such as self-harm and suicidal behavior. In fact, individuals with borderline personality\\ndisorder engage in more suicide attempts, and completion of suicide is higher among these individuals\\nthan the general public (Linehan et al., 2015). Other impulsive behaviors, such as non-suicidal self-\\ninjury (cutting) and sexual promiscuity, are frequently seen within this population, typically occurring\\nduring high-stress periods (Sansone & Sansone, 2012). They often have chronic feelings of emptiness\\nalong with painful feelings of aloneness. Occasionally, hallucinations and delusions are present,\\nparticularly of a paranoid nature; however, these symptoms are often transient and recognized as\\nunacceptable by the individual (Sieswerda & Arntz, 2007).\\n     13.1.3.3. Histrionic personality disorder. Histrionic personality disorder is the first\\npersonality disorder that addresses pervasive and excessive emotionality and attention-seeking. These\\nindividuals are usually uncomfortable in social settings unless they are the center of attention. To help\\ngain attention, the individual is often vivacious and dramatic, using physical gestures and mannerisms\\nalong with grandiose language. These behaviors are initially very charming to their audience; however,\\nthey begin to wear due to the constant need for attention to be on them. If the theatrical nature does\\nnot gain the attention they desire, they may go to great lengths to draw attention, such as using a\\nfictitious story or creating a dramatic scene.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n259\\nTo ensure they gain the attention they desire, individuals with histrionic personality disorder frequently\\ndress and engage in sexually seductive or provocative ways. These sexually charged behaviors are not\\nonly directed at those in which they have a sexual or romantic interest but to the general public as well\\n(APA, 2022). They often spend a significant amount of time on their physical appearance to gain the\\nattention they desire.\\nIndividuals with histrionic personality disorder are easily suggestible. Their opinions and feelings are\\ninfluenced by not only their friends but also by current fads (APA, 2022). They also tend to exaggerate\\nrelationships, considering casual acquaintanceships as more intimate than they are.\\n     13.1.3.4. Narcissistic personality disorder. Like histrionic personality disorder, narcissistic\\npersonality disorder also centers around the individual; however, with narcissistic personality\\ndisorder, individuals display a pattern of grandiosity along with a lack of empathy for others (APA,\\n2022).  The grandiose sense of self leads to an overvaluation of their abilities and accomplishments.\\nThey often come across as boastful and pretentious, repeatedly proclaiming their superior\\nachievements. These proclamations may also be fantasized to enhance their success or power.\\nOftentimes they identify themselves as “special” and will only interact with others of high status.\\nGiven the grandiose sense of self, it is not surprising that individuals with narcissistic personality\\ndisorder need excessive admiration from others. While it appears that their self-esteem is hugely\\ninflated, it is very fragile and dependent on how others perceive them (APA, 2022).  Because of this,\\nthey may constantly seek out compliments and expect favorable treatment from others. When this sense\\nof entitlement is not upheld, they can become irritated or angry that their needs are not met.\\nA lack of empathy is also displayed in individuals with narcissistic personality disorder as they often\\nstruggle to (or choose not to) recognize the desires or needs of others. This lack of empathy also leads\\nto exploitation of interpersonal relationships, as they are unable to understand other’s feelings\\n(Marcoux et al., 2014). They often become envious of others who achieve greater success or possessions\\nthan them. Conversely, they believe everyone should be envious of their achievements, regardless of\\nhow small they may be.\\n \\n13.1.4. Cluster C\\n     13.1.4.1. Avoidant personality disorder. Individuals with avoidant personality disorder display\\na pervasive pattern of social inhibition due to feelings of inadequacy and increased sensitivity to\\nnegative evaluations (APA, 2022). The fear of being rejected drives their reluctance to engage in social\\nsituations so that they may prevent others from evaluating them negatively. This fear extends so far that\\nit prevents individuals from maintaining employment due to their intense fear of negative evaluation or\\nrejection.\\nSocially, they have very few if any friends, despite their desire to establish social relationships. They\\nactively avoid social situations in which they can develop new friendships out of the fear of being\\ndisliked or ridiculed. Similarly, they are cautious of new activities or relationships as they often\\nexaggerate the potential negative consequences and embarrassment that may occur; this is likely a\\nresult of their ongoing preoccupation with being criticized or rejected by others. Within intimate\\nrelationships, their fear of being shamed or ridiculed leads to restraint, and they view themselves as\\nsocially inept (APA, 2022).'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n260\\n \\nMaking Sense of the Disorders\\nAs you read the clinical description of avoidant personality disorder, did you think it sounded a lot like\\nsocial anxiety disorder? You likely did as there is a great deal of overlap between the two disorders. So,\\nhow do they differ if they are to be regarded as separate diagnostic categories in the DSM? This\\ndifference is linked to self-concept. How so?\\nIn social anxiety disorder the negative self-concept is unstable and less pervasive and entrenched.\\nIn avoidant personality disorder, the negative self-concept is more stable as an enduring and\\npervasive pattern, typical of personality traits.\\nAdditionally, avoidant personality disorder frequently occurs in the absence of social anxiety disorder\\nand some separate risk factors have been identified for the two.\\n     13.1.4.2. Dependent personality disorder.   Dependent personality disorder is characterized\\nby pervasive and excessive need to be taken care of by others (APA, 2022). This intense need leads to\\nsubmissive and clinging behaviors as they fear they will be abandoned or separated from their parent,\\nspouse, or another person with whom they are in a dependent relationship. They are so dependent on\\nthis other individual that they cannot make even the smallest decisions without first consulting with\\nthem and gaining their approval or reassurance. They often allow others to assume complete\\nresponsibility for their life, making decisions in nearly all aspects of their lives. Rarely will they\\nchallenge these decisions as their fear of losing this relationship greatly outweighs their desire to\\nexpress their own opinion. Should the relationship end, the individual experiences significant feelings of\\nhelplessness and quickly seeks out another relationship to replace the old one (APA, 2022).\\nWhen they are on their own, individuals with dependent personality disorder express difficulty initiating\\nand engaging in tasks on their own. They lack self-confidence and feel helpless when they are left to\\ncare for themselves or engage in tasks on their own. So that they do not have to engage in tasks alone,\\nindividuals will go to great lengths to seek out support of others, often volunteering for unpleasant\\ntasks if it means they will get the reassurance they need (APA, 2022).\\n     13.1.4.3. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD). OCPD is defined by an\\nindividual’s preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, and ability to control situations that they\\nlose flexibility, openness, and efficiency in everyday life (APA, 2022). One’s preoccupation with details,\\nrules, lists, order, organization, or schedules overshadows the larger picture of the task or activity. In\\nfact, the need to complete the task or activity is significantly impacted by the individual’s self-imposed\\nhigh standards and need to complete the task perfectly, that the task often does not get completed. The\\ndesire to complete the task perfectly often causes the individual to spend an excessive amount of time\\non the task, occasionally repeating it until it is to their standard. Due to repetition and attention to fine\\ndetail, the individual often does not have time to engage in leisure activities or engage in social\\nrelationships. Despite the excessive amount of time spent on activities or tasks, individuals with OCPD\\nwill not seek help from others, as they are convinced that the others are incompetent and will not\\ncomplete the task up to their standard.\\nPersonally, individuals with OCD are rigid and stubborn, particularly with their morals, ethics, and'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n261\\nvalues. Not only do they hold these standards for themselves, but they also expect others to have\\nsimilarly high standards, thus causing significant disruption to their social interactions. The rigid and\\nstubborn behaviors are also seen in their financial status, as they are known to live significantly below\\ntheir means to prepare financially for a potential catastrophe (APA, 2022). Similarly, they may have\\ndifficulty discarding worn-out or worthless items, despite their lack of sentimental value.\\nThough on the surface it may appear that OCPD and OCD are one and the same, there is a distinct\\ndifference as the personality disorder lacks definitive obsessions and compulsions (APA, 2022). In fact,\\nmost individuals with OCD do not have a pattern of behavior that meets criteria for this personality\\ndisorder.\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nPersonality disorders share the features of distorted thinking patterns, problematic emotional\\nresponses, over- or under-regulated impulse control, and interpersonal difficulties and divide into\\nthree clusters.\\nCluster A personality disorders are described as the odd/eccentric cluster and share as the\\ncommon feature social awkwardness and social withdrawal.

Comorbidity\\n \\nSection Learning Objectives\\nDescribe the comorbidity of personality disorders.\\n \\nAmong the most common comorbid diagnoses with personality disorders are mood disorders, anxiety\\ndisorders, and substance abuse disorders (Lenzenweger, Lane, Loranger, & Kessler, 2007). A large\\nmeta-analysis exploring the data on the comorbidity of major depressive disorder and personality\\ndisorders indicated a high diagnosis of major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and dysthymia\\n(Friborg, Martinsen, Martinussen, Kaiser, Overgard, & Rosenvinge, 2014). Further exploration of major\\ndepressive disorder suggested the lowest rate of diagnosis in Cluster A disorders, higher rate in Cluster\\nB disorders, and the highest rate in Cluster C disorders. While the relationship between bipolar\\ndisorder and personality disorders has not been consistently clear, the most recent findings report a\\nhigh comorbidity between Cluster B personality disorders, with the exception of OCPD (which is in\\nCluster C), which had the highest comorbidity rate than any other personality disorder.  Overall analysis\\nof dysthymia suggested that it is the most diagnosed depressive disorder among all personality\\ndisorders.\\nA more detailed analysis exploring the prevalence rates of the four main anxiety disorders (generalized\\nanxiety disorder, specific phobia, social phobia, and panic disorder) among individuals with various\\npersonality disorders found a clear relationship specific to personality disorders and anxiety disorders\\n(Skodol, Geier, Grant, & Hasin, 2014). More specifically, individuals diagnosed with borderline and\\nschizotypal personality disorders were found to have an additional diagnosis of one of the four main\\nanxiety disorders. Individuals with narcissistic personality disorder were more likely to be diagnosed\\nwith generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder; schizoid and avoidant personality disorders\\nreported significant rates of generalized anxiety disorder; avoidant personality disorder had a higher\\ndiagnosis rate of social phobia. Substance use disorders occur less frequently across the ten personality\\ndisorders but are most common in individuals diagnosed with antisocial, borderline, and schizotypal\\npersonality disorders (Grant et al., 2015).

The following is a general overview of contributing factors to personality\\ndisorders. While there is some research lending itself to specific causes of specific personality\\ndisorders, the overall contribution of biological, psychological, and social factors will be reviewed.\\n \\n13.4.1. Biological\\nResearch across the personality disorders suggests some underlying biological or genetic component;'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n267\\nhowever, identification of specific mechanisms have not been identified in most disorders, except for\\nthose below. Because of this lack of concrete evidence, researchers argue that it is difficult to\\ndetermine what role genetics plays into the development of these disorders compared to that of\\nenvironmental influences. Therefore, while there is likely a biological predisposition to personality\\ndisorders, exact causes cannot be determined at this time.\\nResearch on the development of schizotypal personality disorder has identified similar biological causes\\nto that of schizophrenia—high activity of dopamine and enlarged brain ventricles (Lener et al., 2015).\\nSimilar differences in neuroanatomy may explain the high similarity of behaviors in both schizophrenia\\nand schizotypal personality disorder.\\nSurprisingly, antisocial personality disorder and borderline personality disorder also have similar\\nneurological changes. More specifically, individuals with both disorders reportedly show deficits in\\nserotonin activity (Thompson, Ramos, & Willett, 2014). These low levels of serotonin activity in\\ncombination with deficient functioning of the frontal lobes—particularly the prefrontal cortex which is\\nused in planning, self-control, and decision making—as well as an overly reactive amygdala, may explain\\nthe impulsive and aggressive nature of both antisocial and borderline personality disorder (Stone,\\n2014).\\n \\n13.4.2. Psychological\\nPsychodynamic, cognitive, and behavioral theories are among the most common psychological models\\nused to explain the development of personality disorders. Although much is still speculation, the\\nfollowing are general etiological views with regards to each specific theory.\\n     13.4.2.1. Psychodynamic. The psychodynamic theory places a large emphasis on negative early\\nchildhood experiences and how these experiences impact an individual’s inability to establish healthy\\nrelationships in adulthood. More specifically, individuals with personality disorders report higher levels\\nof childhood stress, such as living in impoverished environments, exposure to domestic violence, and\\nexperiencing repeated maltreatment (Kumari et al., 2014). Additionally, high levels of childhood neglect\\nand parental rejection are also observed in personality disorder patients, with early parental loss and\\nrejection leading to fears of abandonment throughout an individual’s life (Newnham & Janca, 2014;\\nRoepke & Varter, 2014; Caligor & Clarkin, 2010).\\nPsychodynamic theorists believe that maltreatment in early childhood has the potential to negatively\\naffect an individual’s sense of self and their perception of others, leading to the development of a\\npersonality disorder. For example, an individual who was neglected as a young child and deprived of\\nlove may report a lack of trust in others as an adult, a characteristic of antisocial personality disorder\\n(Meloy & Yakeley, 2010). Difficulty trusting others or beliefs that they are unable to be loved may also\\nimpact one’s ability or desire to establish social relationships, as seen in many personality disorders,\\nparticularly schizoid. Because of these early childhood deficits, individuals may also overcompensate in\\ntheir relationships to convince themselves that they are worthy of love and affection (Celani, 2014).\\nConversely, individuals may respond to their early childhood experiences by becoming emotionally\\ndistant, using relationships as a sense of power and destructiveness.\\n     13.4.2.2. Cognitive. While psychodynamic theory emphasizes early childhood experiences,\\ncognitive theorists focus on the maladaptive thought patterns and cognitive distortions displayed by'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n268\\nthose with personality disorders. Overall deficiencies in thinking can lead individuals with personality\\ndisorders to develop inaccurate perceptions of others (Beck, 2015). These dysfunctional beliefs likely\\noriginate from the interaction between a biological predisposition and undesirable environmental\\nexperiences. Maladaptive thought patterns and strategies are strengthened during aversive life events\\nas a protective mechanism and ultimately come together to form patterns of behavior displayed in\\npersonality disorders (Beck, 2015).\\nCognitive distortions such as dichotomous thinking, also known as all-or-nothing thinking, are\\nobserved in several personality disorders. More specifically, dichotomous thinking explains rigidity and\\nperfectionism in OCPD, and the lack of self-sufficiency among individuals with dependent and\\nborderline personality disorders (Weishaar & Beck, 2006). Discounting the positive also explains the\\nunderlying mechanisms for avoidant personality disorder (Weishaar & Beck, 2006). For example,\\nindividuals who have been routinely criticized or rejected during childhood may have difficulty\\naccepting positive feedback from others, expecting only to receive rejection and harsh criticism. In fact,\\nthey may employ these misattributions to positive feedback to support their ongoing theory that they\\nare constantly rejected and criticized by others.\\n     13.4.2.3. Behavioral. Behavioral theorists apply three major theories to explain the development of\\npersonality disorders: modeling, reinforcement, and lack of social skills. In modeling, an individual\\nlearns maladaptive social patterns and behaviors by directly observing family members engaging in\\nsimilar behaviors (Gaynor & Baird, 2007). While we cannot discredit the biological component of the\\nfamilial influence, research does support an additive modeling or imitating component to the\\ndevelopment of personality disorders, especially antisocial personality disorder (APA, 2022).\\nReinforcement, or rewarding of maladaptive behaviors is also observed in the development of many\\npersonality disorders. Parents may unintentionally reward aggressive behaviors by giving in to a child’s\\ndesires to cease the situation or prevent escalation of behaviors. When this is done repeatedly over\\ntime, children (and later as adults) continue with these maladaptive behaviors as they are effective in\\ngaining their needs and wants. On the other side, there is some speculation that excessive\\nreinforcement or praise during childhood may contribute to the grandiose sense of self observed in\\nindividuals with narcissistic personality disorder (Millon, 2011).\\nFinally, failure to develop normal social skills may explain the development of some personality\\ndisorders, such as avoidant personality disorder (Kantor, 2010).\\n \\n13.4.3. Social\\n     13.4.3.1. Family dysfunction. High levels of psychological and social dysfunction within families\\nhave also been identified as contributing factors to the development of personality disorders. High\\nlevels of poverty, unemployment, family separation, and witnessing domestic violence are routinely\\nobserved in individuals diagnosed with personality disorders (Paris, 1996). While formalized research\\nhas yet to explore the relationship between SES and personality disorders fully, correlational studies\\nsuggest a link between poverty, unemployment, and poor academic achievement with increased levels\\nof personality disorder diagnoses (Alwin, 2006).\\n     13.4.3.2. Childhood maltreatment. Childhood maltreatment is among the most influential\\nargument for the development of personality disorders in adulthood. Individuals with personality'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n269\\ndisorders often struggle with a sense of self and the ability to relate to others—something that is\\ngenerally developed during the first four to six years of a child’s life, and it is affected by the emotional\\nenvironment in which that child was raised. This sense of self is the mechanism in which individuals\\nview themselves within their social context, while also informing attitudes and expectations of others. A\\nchild who experiences significant maltreatment, whether it be through neglect or physical, emotional,\\nor sexual abuse, is at-risk for an underdeveloped or absent sense of self. Due to the lack of affection,\\ndiscipline, or autonomy during childhood, these individuals are unable to engage in appropriate\\nrelationships as adults as seen across the spectrum of personality disorders.\\nAnother way childhood maltreatment contributes to personality disorders is through the emotional\\nbonds or attachments developed with primary caregivers. John Bowlby thoroughly researched the\\nrelationship between attachment and emotional development as he explored the need for affection in\\nHarlow monkeys (Bowlby, 1998). Based on Bowlby’s research, four attachment styles have been\\nidentified: secure, anxious, ambivalent, and disorganized. While securely attached children\\ngenerally do not develop personality disorders, those with anxious, ambivalent, and disorganized\\nattachment are at an increased risk of developing various disorders. More specifically, those with an\\nanxious attachment are at-risk for developing internalizing disorders, ambivalent are at-risk for\\ndeveloping externalizing disorders, and disorganized are at-risk for dissociative symptoms and\\npersonality-related disorders (Alwin, 2006).\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nBiological causes of personality disorders have not been identified in most disorders, the\\nexception being schizotypal which has similar biological causes as schizophrenia and antisocial\\nand borderline personality disorders which have similar neurological changes.\\nPsychological causes of personality disorders include negative early childhood experiences;\\nmaladaptive thought patterns and cognitive distortions; and modeling, reinforcement, and lack of\\nsocial skills.\\nSocial causes of personality disorders include high levels of psychological and social dysfunction\\nwithin families and maltreatment.\\n \\nSection 13.4 Review Questions\\nWhat personality disorders are most explained by the biological model?1.\\nHow does the psychodynamic model explain the development of personality disorders?2.\\nWhat cognitive distortions are most discussed with respect to personality disorders?3.\\nWhat are the three behavioral theories used to explain the development of personality disorders?4.\\nDiscuss the role of attachment and how theorists have used it to explain the development of5.\\npersonality disorders.'),\n",

Treatment\\n \\nSection Learning Objectives\\nDescribe treatment options for personality disorders.\\n \\n13.5.1. Cluster A\\nIndividuals with personality disorders within Cluster A often do not seek out treatment as they do not\\nidentify themselves as someone who needs help (Millon, 2011). Of those that do seek treatment, the\\nmajority do not enter it willingly. Furthermore, due to the nature of these disorders, individuals in\\ntreatment often struggle to trust the clinician as they are suspicious of the clinician’s intentions\\n(paranoid and schizotypal personality disorder) or are emotionally distant from the clinician as they do\\nnot have a desire to engage in treatment due to lack of overall emotion (schizoid personality disorder;\\nKellett & Hardy, 2014, Colli, Tanzilli, Dimaggio, & Lingiardi, 2014). Because of this, treatment is known\\nto move very slowly, with many patients dropping out before any resolution of symptoms.\\nWhen patients are enrolled in treatment, cognitive-behavioral strategies are most commonly used with\\nthe primary intention of reducing anxiety-related symptoms. Additionally, attempts at cognitive\\nrestructuring—both identifying and changing maladaptive thought patterns—are also helpful in\\naddressing the misinterpretations of other’s words and actions, particularly for individuals with\\nparanoid personality disorder (Kellett & Hardy, 2014). Schizoid personality disorder patients may\\nengage in CBT techniques to help experience more positive emotions and more satisfying social\\nexperiences, whereas the goal of CBT for schizotypal personality disorder is to evaluate unusual\\nthoughts or perceptions objectively and to ignore the inappropriate thoughts (Beck & Weishaar, 2011).\\nFinally, behavioral techniques such as social-skills training may also be implemented to address ongoing\\ninterpersonal problems displayed in the disorders.\\n \\n13.5.2. Cluster B\\n     13.5.2.1. Antisocial personality disorder. Treatment options for antisocial personality disorder\\nare limited and generally not effective (Black, 2015). Like Cluster A disorders, many individuals are\\nforced to participate in treatment, thus impacting their ability to engage in and continue with\\ntreatment. Cognitive therapists have attempted to address the lack of morality and encourage patients\\nto think about the needs of others (Beck & Weishaar, 2011).\\n     13.5.2.2. Borderline personality disorder. Borderline personality disorder is the one personality\\ndisorder with an effective treatment option—Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT). DBT is a form of\\ncognitive-behavioral therapy developed by Marsha Linehan (Linehan, Armstrong, Suarez, Allmon, &'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n271\\nHeard, 1991). There are four main goals of DBT: reduce suicidal behavior, reduce therapy interfering\\nbehavior, improve quality of life, and reduce post-traumatic stress symptoms.\\nWithin DBT, five main treatment components collectively help to reduce harmful behaviors (i.e., self-\\nmutilation and suicidal behaviors) and replace them with practical, life-enhancing behaviors (Gonidakis,\\n2014). The first component is skills training. Generally performed in a group therapy setting, individuals\\nengage in mindfulness, distress tolerance, interpersonal effectiveness, and emotion regulation. Second,\\nindividuals focus on enhancing motivation and applying skills learned in the previous component to\\nspecific challenges and events in their everyday life. The third, and often the most distinctive aspect of\\nDBT, is the use of telephone and in vivo coaching for DBT patients from the DBT clinical team. It is not\\nuncommon for patients to have the cell phone number of their clinician for 24/7 availability of in-the-\\nmoment support. The fourth component, case management, consists of allowing the patient to become\\ntheir own “case manager” and effectively use the learned DBT techniques to problem-solve ongoing\\nissues. Within this component, the clinician will only intervene when absolutely necessary. Finally, the\\nconsultation team, is a service for the clinicians providing the DBT treatment. Due to the high demands\\nof borderline personality disorder patients, the consultation team offers support to the providers in their\\nwork to ensure they remain motivated and competent in DBT principles to provide the best treatment\\npossible.\\nSupport for the effectiveness of DBT in borderline personality disorder patients has been implicated in\\nseveral randomized control trials (Harned, Korslund, & Linehan, 2014; Neacsiu, Eberle, Kramer,\\nWisemeann, & Linehan, 2014). More specifically, DBT has shown to significantly reduce suicidality and\\nself-harm behaviors in those with borderline personality disorders. Additionally, the drop-out rates for\\ntreatment are extremely low, suggesting that patients value the treatment components and find them\\nuseful in managing symptoms.\\n     13.5.2.3. Histrionic personality disorder. Individuals with histrionic personality disorder are\\nmore likely to seek out treatment than other personality disorder patients. Unfortunately, due to the\\nnature of the disorder, they are very difficult patients to treat as they are quick to employ their\\ndemands and seductiveness within the treatment setting. The overall goal for the treatment of histrionic\\npersonality disorder is to help the patient identify their dependency and become more self-reliant.\\nCognitive therapists utilize techniques to help patients change their helpless beliefs and improve\\nproblem-solving skills (Beck & Weishaar, 2011).\\n     13.5.2.4. Narcissistic personality disorder. Of all the personality disorders, narcissistic\\npersonality disorder is among the most difficult to treat (with maybe the exception of antisocial\\npersonality disorder). Most individuals with narcissistic personality disorder only seek out treatment for\\nthose disorders secondary to their personality disorder, such as depression (APA, 2022). The focus of\\ntreatment is to address the grandiose, self-centered thinking, while also trying to teach patients how to\\nempathize with others (Beck & Weishaar, 2014).\\n \\n13.5.3. Cluster C\\nWhile many individuals within avoidant and OCPD personality disorders seek out treatment to address\\ntheir anxiety or depressive symptoms, it is often difficult to keep them in treatment due to distrust or\\nfear of rejection from the clinician.  Treatment goals for avoidant personality disorder are similar to that\\nof social anxiety disorder. CBT techniques, such as identifying and challenging distressing thoughts,'),\n",

Specific to OCPD,\\ncognitive techniques aimed at changing dichotomous thinking, perfectionism, and chronic worrying\\nhelp manage symptoms of OCPD. Behavioral treatments such as gradual exposure to various social\\nsettings, along with a combination of social skills training, have been shown to improve individuals’\\nconfidence prior to engaging in social outings when treating avoidant personality disorder (Herbert,\\n2007).

Cognitive strategies such as challenging and changing thoughts on helplessness and inability to\\ncare for oneself have been minimally effective in establishing independence.

Therefore, it is important that individuals presenting with\\nthese symptoms complete a medical assessment to better determine the etiology behind the disorder.\\nThere are three main categories of neurocognitive disorders—delirium, major neurocognitive disorder,\\nand mild neurocognitive disorder. Within major and minor neurocognitive disorders are several\\nsubtypes due to the etiology of the disorder. For this book, we will review diagnostic criteria for both\\nmajor and minor neurocognitive disorders, followed by a brief description of the various disease\\nsubtypes in the etiology section.\\nIt is important to note as well that the criteria for the various NCDs are based on defined cognitive\\ndomains. These include the following, with a brief explanation of what it is:\\nComplex attention – Sustained, divided, or selective attention and processing speed1.\\nExecutive function – planning, decision-making, overriding habits, mental flexibility, and2.\\nresponding to feedback/error correction\\nLearning and memory – includes cued recall, immediate or long-term memory, and implicit3.\\nlearning\\nLanguage – Includes expressive language and receptive language4.\\nPerceptual-motor – Includes any abilities related to visual perception, gnosis, perceptual-motor5.\\npraxis, or visuo-constructional\\nSocial cognition – Includes recognition of emotions and theory of mind6.\\n \\n14.1.1. Delirium\\nDelirium is characterized by a notable disturbance in attention along with reduced awareness of the\\nenvironment. The disturbance develops over a short period of time, representing a change from\\nbaseline attention and awareness, and fluctuates in severity during the day. There is also a disturbance\\nin cognitive performance that is significantly altered from one’s usual behavior. Disturbances in\\nattention are often manifested as difficulty sustaining, shifting, or focusing attention. Additionally, an\\nindividual experiencing an episode of delirium will have a disruption in cognition, including confusion of\\nwhere they are. Disorganized thinking, incoherent speech, and hallucinations and delusions may also be\\nobserved during periods of delirium.\\nDelirium is associated with increased functional decline and risk of being placed in an institution. That\\nsaid, most people with delirium recover fully with or without treatment, especially if not elderly, but if\\nundetected or the underlying cause is untreated, it may progress to stupor, coma, seizures, or death\\n(APA, 2022).\\n \\n14.1.2. Major Neurocognitive Disorder\\nIndividuals with major neurocognitive disorder show a significant decline in both overall cognitive\\nfunctioning (see the previously listed six domains) as well as the ability to independently meet the'),\n",

While\\nit is not necessary, it is helpful to have documentation of the cognitive decline via neuropsychological\\ntesting within a controlled, standardized testing environment. Information from close family members\\nor caregivers is also important in documenting the decline and impairment in areas of functioning.\\nWithin the umbrella of major neurocognitive disorder is dementia, a striking decline in cognition and\\nself-help skills due to a neurocognitive disorder. The DSM-5-TR (APA, 2022) refrained from using this\\nterm in diagnostic categories as it is often used to describe the natural decline in degenerative\\ndementias that affect older adults; whereas neurocognitive disorder is the preferred term used to\\ndescribe conditions affecting younger individuals such as impairment due to traumatic brain injuries or\\nother medical conditions. Therefore, while dementia is accurate in describing those experiencing major\\nneurocognitive disorder due to age, it is not reflective of those experiencing neurocognitive issues\\nsecondary to an injury or illness.\\n \\n14.1.3. Mild Neurocognitive Disorder\\nIndividuals with mild neurocognitive disorder demonstrate a modest decline in one of the listed\\ncognitive domains. The decline in functioning is not as extensive as that seen in major neurocognitive\\ndisorder, and the individual does not experience difficulty independently engaging in daily activities.\\nHowever, they may require assistance or extra time to complete these tasks, particularly if the cognitive\\ndecline continues to progress.\\nIt should be noted that the primary difference between major and mild neurocognitive disorder is the\\nseverity of the decline and independent functioning. Some argue that the two are earlier and later\\nstages of the same disease process (Blaze, 2013). Conversely, individuals can go from major to mild\\nneurocognitive disorder following recovery from a stroke or traumatic brain injury (Petersen, 2011).\\nThe DSM-5-TR describes major and mild NCD as existing on a spectrum of cognitive and functional\\nimpairment (APA, 2022, pg. 685).\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nThe criteria for the various NCDs are based on the cognitive domains of complex attention,\\nexecutive function, learning and memory, language, perceptual-motor, and social cognition.\\nDelirium is characterized by a notable disturbance in attention or awareness and cognitive\\nperformance that is significantly altered from one’s usual behavior.\\nMajor neurocognitive disorder is characterized by a significant decline in both overall cognitive\\nfunctioning as well as the ability to independently meet the demands of daily living.\\nMild neurocognitive disorder is characterized by a modest decline in one of the listed cognitive\\nareas with no interference in one’s ability to complete daily activities.'),\n",

Major and Mild NCD\\nMajor and mild neurocognitive disorder prevalence rates vary widely depending on the etiological\\nnature of the disorder and overall prevalence estimates are generally only available for older\\npopulations. Internationally, dementia occurs in 1-2% of individuals at age 65, and up to 30% of\\nindividuals by age 85. The female gender is associated with higher prevalence of dementia overall.\\nEstimates for mild NCD among older individuals range from 2% to 10% at age 65 and 5% to 25% at age\\n85.

As you will see, most of these neurocognitive disorders are\\nboth degenerative, meaning the symptoms and cognitive deficits become worse over time, as well as\\nrelated to a medical condition or disease.\\nPer the DSM-5-TR (APA, 2022), an individual will meet diagnostic criteria for either mild or major\\nneurocognitive disorder as listed above. In order to specify the type of neurocognitive disorder,\\nadditional diagnostic criteria specific to one of the following subtypes must be met.\\n \\n14.3.1. Alzheimer’s Disease\\nAlzheimer’s disease is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder. While the primary symptom of\\nAlzheimer’s disease is the gradual progression of impairment in cognition, it is also important to\\nidentify concrete evidence of cognitive decline. This can be done in one of two ways: via genetic testing\\nof the individual or a documented family history of the disease, or, through clear evidence of cognitive\\ndecline over time by repeated standardized neuropsychological evaluations (APA, 2022). It is crucial to\\nidentify these markers in making the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease as some individuals present with\\nmemory impairment but eventually show a reversal of symptoms; this is not the case for individuals\\nwith Alzheimer’s disease.\\n     14.3.1.1. Causes of Alzheimer’s disease. Autopsies of individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer’s\\ndisease identify two abnormal brain structures— beta-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary\\ntangles— both of which are responsible for neuron death, inflammation, and loss of cellular\\nconnections (Lazarov, Mattson, Peterson, Pimplika, & van Praag, 2010). It is believed that beta-amyloid\\nplaques, large bundles of plaque that develop between neurons, appear before the development of\\ndementia symptoms. As these plaque bundles increase in size and number, cognitive symptoms and\\nimpaired daily functioning become evident to close family members. Neurofibrillary tangles are believed\\nto appear after the onset of dementia symptoms and are found inside of cells, affecting the protein that\\nhelps transport nutrients in healthy cells. Both beta-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles impact\\nthe health of neurons within the hippocampus, amygdala, and the cerebral cortex, areas associated with\\nmemory and cognition (Spires-Jones & Hyman, 2014).\\nResearchers have identified additional genetic and environmental influences in the development of\\nAlzheimer’s disorder. Genetically, the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene that helps to eliminate beta-\\namyloid by-products from the brain, has been implicated in the development of Alzheimer’s disorder.\\nOne of the three variants of this gene, the e4 allele, appears to reduce the production of ApoE, thus\\nincreasing the number of beta-amyloid plaques within the brain. However, not all individuals with the\\ne4 allele develop Alzheimer’s disease; therefore, this explanation may better explain a vulnerability to\\nAlzheimer’s disease as opposed to the cause of the disease.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n281\\nVarious brain regions have also been implicated in the development of Alzheimer’s disease. More\\nspecifically, neurons shrinking or dying within the hypothalamus, thalamus, and the locus ceruleus have\\nbeen linked to declining cognition (Selkoe, 2011, 1992). Acetylcholine-secreting neurons within the\\nbasal forebrain also appear to shrink or die, contributing to Alzheimer’s disease symptoms (Hsu et al.,\\n2015).\\nEnvironmental toxins such as high levels of zinc and lead may also contribute to the development of\\nAlzheimer’s disease. More precisely, zinc has been linked to the clumping of beta-amyloid proteins\\nthroughout the brain.  Although lead has largely been phased out of environmental toxins due to\\nnegative health consequences, current elderly individuals were exposed to these toxic levels of lead in\\ngasoline and paint as young children. There is some speculation that lead and other pollutants may\\nimpact cognitive functioning in older adults (Richardson et al., 2014).\\n     14.3.1.2. Onset of Alzheimer’s disease.  Alzheimer’s disease is defined by the onset of symptoms.\\nEarly-onset Alzheimer’s disease occurs before the age of 65. While only a small percentage of\\nindividuals experience early onset of the disease, those that do experience early disease progression\\nappear to have a more genetically influenced condition and a higher rate of family members with the\\ndisease.\\nLate-onset Alzheimer’s disease occurs after the age of 65 and has less of a familial influence. This onset\\nappears to occur due to a combination of biological, environmental, and lifestyle factors (Chin-Chan,\\nNavarro-Yepes, & Quintanilla-Vega, 2015). Nearly 30% of individuals within this class of diagnosis have\\nthe ApoE gene that fails to eliminate the beta-amyloid proteins from various brain structures. It is\\nbelieved that the combination of the presence of this gene along with environmental toxins and lifestyle\\nchoices (i.e., more stress) impact the development of Alzheimer’s disease.\\n \\n14.3.2. Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)\\nTBIs occur when an individual experiences significant trauma or damage to the head. Neurocognitive\\ndisorder due to TBI is diagnosed when persistent cognitive impairment is observed immediately\\nfollowing the head injury, along with one or more of the following symptoms: loss of consciousness,\\nposttraumatic amnesia, disorientation and confusion, or neurological impairment (APA, 2022).\\nThe presentation of symptoms varies among individuals and depends largely on the location of the\\ninjury and the intensity of the trauma. Furthermore, the effects of a TBI can be temporary or\\npermanent. Symptoms generally range from headaches, disorientation, confusion, irritability, fatigue,\\npoor concentration, and emotional and behavioral changes. More severe injuries can result in more\\nsignificant neurological symptoms such as seizures, paralysis, and visual disturbances.\\nMajor or mild NCD due to TBI may be comorbid with specified or unspecified depressive, anxiety, or\\npersonality disorders and PTSD. Rates of suicidal ideation are as high as 10% with rates of suicide\\nattempt hovering around 0.8% to 1.7% (APA, 2022).\\nThe most common type of TBI is a concussion. A concussion occurs when there is a significant blow to\\nthe head, followed by changes in brain functioning. It often causes immediate disorientation or loss of\\nconsciousness, along with headaches, dizziness, nausea, and sensitivity to light (Alla, Sullivan, &\\nMcCrory, 2012). While symptoms of a concussion are usually temporary, there can be more permanent'),\n",

The media has brought\\nconsiderable attention to this with the recent discussions of chronic traumatic encephalopathy\\n(CTE) which is a progressive, degenerative condition due to repeated head trauma. CTEs are most\\ncommonly seen in athletes (i.e., football players) and military personnel (Baugh et al., 2012). In addition\\nto the neurological symptoms, psychological symptoms such as depression and poor impulse control\\nhave been observed in individuals with CTE. These individuals also appear to be at greater risk for the\\ndevelopment of dementia (McKee et al., 2013).\\n \\n14.3.3. Vascular Disorders\\nNeurocognitive disorders due to vascular disorders can occur from a one-time event such as a stroke or\\nongoing subtle disruptions of blood flow within the brain (APA, 2022). The occurrence of these vascular\\ndisorders general begins with atherosclerosis, or the clogging of arteries due to a build-up of plaque.\\n The plaque builds up over time, eventually causing the artery to narrow, thus reducing the amount of\\nblood able to pass through to other parts of the body. When these arteries within the brain become\\nentirely obstructed, a stroke occurs. The lack of blood flow during a stroke results in the death of\\nneurons and loss of brain function. There are two types of strokes—a hemorrhagic stroke that occurs\\nwhen a blood vessel bursts within the brain and an ischemic stroke, which is when a blood clot blocks\\nthe blood flow in an artery within the brain (American Stroke Association, 2017).\\nWhile strokes can occur at any age, the majority of strokes occur after age 65 (Hall, Levant, &\\nDeFrances, 2012). A wide range of cognitive, behavioral, and emotional changes occur following a\\nstroke. Symptoms are generally dependent on the location of the stroke within the brain as well as the\\nextensiveness of damage to those brain regions (Poels et al., 2012). For example, strokes that occur on\\nthe left side of the brain tend to cause problems with speech and language, as well as physical\\nmovement on the right side of the body; whereas strokes that occur on the right side of the brain tend\\nto cause problems with impulsivity and impaired judgement, short-term memory loss, and physical\\nmovement on the left side of the body (Hedna et al., 2013).\\nAfter Alzheimer’s disease, vascular disease is the second most common cause of NCD and population\\nprevalence estimates are 0.98% for those between the ages of 71-79 years, 4.09% for individuals aged\\n80-89 years, and 6.19% for those aged 90 years and up. Within three months of a stroke, 20%-30% of\\npeople are diagnosed with dementia. Finally, stroke is more common in men up to age 65 and after that,\\nit shifts to women. Vascular disease is frequently comorbid with major or mild NCD due to Alzheimer’s\\ndisease and depression.\\n \\n14.3.4. Substance/Medication-Induced Major or Mild NCD\\nSignificant cognitive changes occur due to repetitive drug and alcohol abuse. Delirium can be observed\\nin individuals with extreme substance intoxication, withdrawal, or even when multiple substances have\\nbeen used within a close period (APA, 2022). While delirium symptoms are often transient during these\\nstates, mild neurocognitive impairment due to heavy substance abuse may remain until a significant\\nperiod of abstinence is observed (Stavro, Pelletier, & Potvin, 2013).'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n283\\n14.3.5. Dementia with Lewy Bodies\\nSymptoms associated with neurocognitive disorder due to Lewy bodies include significant fluctuations\\nin attention and alertness; recurrent visual hallucinations; impaired mobility; and sleep disturbances\\nsuch as rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (APA, 2022). While the trajectory of the illness\\ndevelops more rapidly than Alzheimer’s disease, the survival period is similar in that most individuals do\\nnot survive longer than eight years post-diagnosis (Lewy Body Dementia Association, 2017).\\nLewy bodies are irregular brain cells that result from the buildup of abnormal proteins in the nuclei of\\nneurons. These brain cells deplete the cortex of acetylcholine, which causes the behavioral and\\ncognitive symptoms observed in both dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson’s disease. The motor\\nsymptoms seen in both these disorders occur from the depletion of dopamine by the Lewy body nerve\\ncells that accumulate in the brain stem.\\n \\n14.3.6. Major or Mild Frontotemporal NCD\\nFrontotemporal NCD causes “progressive development of behavioral and personality change and/or\\nlanguage impairment”  (APA, 2022, pg. 696). For the behavioral variant, individuals display at least\\nthree of the following: behavioral disinhibition, apathy or inertia, loss of sympathy or empathy,\\npreservative or compulsive behavior, or hyperorality and dietary changes. For the language variant,\\nthey show prominent decline in language ability (i.e., speech production, word finding, object naming,\\ngrammar, or word comprehension). There is relative sparing of learning and memory and perceptual-\\nmotor functioning. Individuals with frontotemporal NCD commonly present in their 50s though the age\\nof onset has a range of age 20 to 80 years. The median survival is 6-11 years after symptom onset and\\n3-4 years after diagnosis (APA, 2022).\\n \\n14.3.7. Parkinson’s Disease\\nThe awareness of Parkinson’s disease has increased in recent years due in large part to Michael J. Fox’s\\nearly diagnosis in 1991. It affects approximately 630,000 individuals (Kowal, Dall, Chakrabarti, Storm,\\n& Jain, 2013). While many are aware of the tremors of hands, arms, legs, and face, the other three main\\nsymptoms of Parkinson’s disease are rigidity of the limbs and trunk; slowness in initiating movement;\\nand drooping posture or impaired balance and coordination (National Institute of Neurological\\nDisorders and Stroke, 2017). These motor symptoms are generally present at least one year prior to the\\nbeginning of cognitive decline, although severity and progression of symptoms vary significantly from\\nperson to person.\\nOnset of Parkinson’s disease is typically from age 50 to 89 years. Mild NCD develops early in the course\\nof Parkinson’s disease while Major NCD does not occur until individuals are much older. The prevalence\\nof Parkinson’s disease in the U.S. increases with age and is more common in men than women. The\\ndisease is comorbid with Alzheimer’s disease and cerebrovascular disease. Depression, psychosis, REM\\nsleep behavior disorder, apathy, and motor symptoms can make functional impairment worse (APA,\\n2022).'),\n",

Huntington’s Disease\\nHuntington’s disease is a rare genetic disorder that involves involuntary movement, progressive\\ndementia, and emotional instability. Due to the degenerative nature of the disorder, there is a shortened\\nlife-expectancy as death typically occurs 15-20 years post-onset of symptoms (Clabough, 2013).\\nAlthough symptoms can present at any time, the average age of symptom presentation is during middle\\nadulthood (between ages 35 and 45 years; APA, 2022). Symptoms generally begin with neurocognitive\\ndecline, particularly in executive function, along with changes in mood and personality. As symptoms\\nprogress, more physical symptoms present, such as facial grimaces, difficulty speaking, and repetitive\\nmovements. Because there is no treatment for Huntington’s disease, the severity of the cognitive and\\nphysical impairments ultimately leads to complete dependency and the need for full-time care. Suicide\\nis among the leading causes of death in Huntington’s disease (APA, 2022).\\n \\n14.3.9. HIV Infection\\nNot many people are aware that cognitive impairment is sometimes the first symptom of untreated HIV.\\nWhile symptoms vary among individuals, slower mental processing, impaired executive function,\\nproblems with more demanding attentional tasks, and difficulty learning new information are among the\\nmost common early signs (APA, 2022). When HIV becomes active in the brain, significant alterations of\\nmental processes occur, thus leading to a diagnosis of neurocognitive disorder due to HIV infection.\\nSignificant impairment can also occur due to HIV-infection related inflammation throughout the central\\nnervous system.\\nFortunately, antiretroviral therapies used in treating HIV have been effective in reducing and\\npreventing the onset of severe cognitive impairments; however, HIV-related brain changes still occur in\\nnearly half of all patients on antiretroviral medication. There is hope that once antiretroviral therapies\\ncan cross the blood-brain barrier in the central nervous system, there will be a significant improvement\\nin the prevalence of HIV-related neurocognitive disorder (Vassallo et al., 2014).\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nMost neurocognitive disorders are degenerative meaning they become worse over time.\\nAlzheimer’s disease is characterized by the gradual progression of impairment in cognition as\\nwell as the presence of beta-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles.\\nTBIs occur when an individual experiences significant trauma or damage to the head with the\\nmost common type being a concussion.\\nVascular disorders generally begin with atherosclerosis which leads to a stroke.\\nSignificant cognitive changes occur due to repetitive drug and alcohol abuse such as delirium.\\nDementia with Lewy bodies is characterized by significant fluctuations in attention and alertness;\\nrecurrent visual hallucinations; impaired mobility; and sleep disturbance.\\nFrontotemporal NCD causes progressive declines in language or behavior due to the degeneration\\nin the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain.'),\n",

Due to possible negative\\nside effects of the medications, these drugs are prescribed to individuals in the early or middle stages of\\nAlzheimer’s as opposed to those with advanced disease. Researchers have also explored treatment\\noptions aimed at preventing the build-up of beta-amyloid and neurofibrillary tangles; however, this\\nresearch is still in its infancy (Alzheimer’s Association, 2017a)\\nParkinson’s disease has also found success in pharmacological treatment options. The medication\\nlevodopa increases dopamine availability, which provides relief of both physical and cognitive\\nsymptoms. Unfortunately, there are also significant side effects such as hallucinations and psychotic\\nsymptoms; therefore, the medication is often only used when the benefits outweigh the negatives of the\\npotential risks (Poletti & Bonuccelli, 2013).\\n \\n14.4.2. Psychological\\nAmong the most effective psychological treatment options for individuals with neurocognitive disorders\\nare the use of cognitive and behavioral strategies. More specifically, engaging in various cognitive\\nactivities such as computer-based cognitive stimulation programs, reading books, and following the\\nnews, have been identified as effective strategies in preventing or delaying the onset of Alzheimer’s\\ndisease (Szalavits, 2013; Wilson, Segawa, Boyle, & Bennett, 2012).\\nEngaging in social skills and self-care training are additional behavioral strategies used to help improve\\nfunctioning in individuals with neurocognitive deficits. For example, by breaking down complex tasks\\ninto smaller, more attainable goals, as well as simplifying the environment (i.e., labeling location of\\nitems, removing clutter), individuals can successfully engage in more independent living activities.\\n \\n14.4.3. Support for Caregivers\\nSupporting caregivers is an important treatment option to include as the emotional and physical toll on\\ncaring for an individual with a neurocognitive disorder is often underestimated. According to the\\nAlzheimer’s Association (2017b), nearly 90% of all individuals with Alzheimer’s disease are cared for by\\na relative. The emotional and physical demands on caring for a family member who continues to decline\\ncognitively and physically can lead to increased anger and depression in a caregiver (Kang et al. 2014).\\nIt is important that medical providers routinely assess caregivers’ psychosocial functioning, and\\nencourage caregivers to participate in caregiver support groups, or individual psychotherapy to address\\ntheir own emotional needs.\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nPharmacological interventions for Alzheimer’s disease target the neurotransmitters acetylcholine\\nand glutamate and newer research is focused on the build-up of beta-amyloid and neurofibrillary'),\n",

Forensic Psychology/Psychiatry\\nAccording to the American Psychological Association, forensic psychology/psychiatry is when clinical\\npsychology is applied to the legal arena in terms of assessment, treatment, and evaluation. Forensic\\npsychology can also include the application of research from other subfields in psychology to include\\ncognitive and social psychology. Training includes law and forensic psychology, and solid clinical skills\\nare a must. According to APA, a forensic psychologist might “perform such tasks as threat assessment\\nfor schools, child custody evaluations, competency evaluations of criminal defendants and of the elderly,\\ncounseling services to victims of crime, death notification procedures, screening and selection of law\\nenforcement applicants, the assessment of post-traumatic stress disorder and the delivery and\\nevaluation of intervention and treatment programs for juvenile and adult offenders.” A key issue\\ninvestigated by forensic psychologists includes mens rea or the insanity plea. We will discuss this\\nshortly.\\nTo learn more about forensic psychology, or to investigate the article mentioned above, please visit:\\nhttp://www.apa.org/ed/precollege/psn/2013/09/forensic-psychology.aspx\\n \\n15.1.2. Civil Commitment\\n     15.1.2.1. What is civil commitment? When individuals with mental illness behave in erratic or\\npotentially dangerous ways, to either themselves or others, then something must be done. The\\nresponsibility to act falls on the government through what is called parens patriae or “father of the\\ncountry” or “country as parent.” Action, in this case, involves involuntary commitment in a hospital or\\nmental health facility and is done to protect the individual and express concern over their well-being,\\nmuch like a parent would do for their child. An individual can voluntarily admit themselves to a mental\\nhealth facility, and upon doing so, staff will determine whether treatment and extended stay are\\nneeded.\\n     15.1.2.2. Criteria for civil commitment. Though states vary in the criteria used to establish the\\nneed for civil commitment, some requirements are common across states. First, the individual must\\npresent a clear danger to either themselves or others. Second, the individual demonstrates that they are\\nunable to care for themself or make decisions about whether treatment or hospitalization is necessary.\\nFinally, the individual believes they are about to lose control, and so, needs treatment or care in a\\nmental health facility.\\n     15.1.2.3. Assessment of “dangerousness.” Dangerousness can best be defined as the person’s'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n290\\ncapacity or likelihood of harming themselves or others. Most people believe that those who are mentally\\nill are more dangerous than those free of mental illness, especially when espousing self-reported\\nconservatism and RWA (Right-Wing Authoritarianism; Gonzales, Chan, and Yanos, 2017; DeLuca and\\nYanos, 2015) or after tragic events such as a mass shooting (Metzl & MacLeish, 2015). The media plays\\na role in this, and as McGinty et al. (2014) found, 70% of news coverage of serious mental illness (SMI)\\nand gun violence over a 16-year period (1997 to 2012) focused on extreme events and described\\nspecific shootings by persons with SMI. The authors wrote, “Even in thematic news coverage focused\\non describing the general problem of SMI and gun violence, the majority of news stories did not\\nmention that most people with SMI are not violent or that we lack tools capable of accurately\\nidentifying persons with SMI who are at heightened risk of committing future violence.” They concluded\\nthat media coverage of persons with SMI as violent might contribute to negative public attitudes.\\nRozel & Mulvey (2017) showed that mental illness is a weak risk factor for violence though this is not to\\nsay that the mentally ill do not commit violent acts. The authors write, “…it has been documented\\nrepeatedly that people who report diagnosable levels of psychiatric symptoms also report more\\ninvolvement in acts of violence toward others than the general population reports.” Approximately 4%\\nof criminal violence can be attributed to the mentally ill (Metzl & MacLeish, 2015), while those with\\nmental illness are three times more likely to be targets and not perpetrators of violence (Choe et al.,\\n2008).\\nRegardless of this, we do attempt to identify the level of dangerousness a person may exhibit or have\\nthe potential to exhibit. How easy is it to make this prediction? As you might think, it can be very\\ndifficult. First, the definition of dangerousness is vague. It implies physical harm, but what about\\npsychological abuse or the destruction of property? Second, past criminal activity is a good predictor of\\nfuture dangerousness but is often not admissible in court. Third, context is critical; in some situations,\\nthe person is perfectly fine, but in other circumstances, like having to wait in line at your local\\nDepartment of Motor Vehicles, the person experiences considerable frustration and eventually anger or\\nrage.\\n     15.1.2.4. Procedures in civil commitment. The process for civil commitment does vary somewhat\\nstate-to-state, but some procedures are held in common. First, a family member, mental health\\nprofessional, or primary care practitioner, may request that the court order an examination of an\\nindividual. If the judge agrees, two professionals, such as a mental health professional or physician, are\\nappointed to examine the person in terms of their ability for self-care, need for treatment, psychological\\ncondition, and likelihood to inflict harm on self or others. Next, a formal hearing gives the examiners a\\nchance to testify as to what they found. Testimonials may also be provided by family and friends, or by\\nthe individual him/herself. Once testimonies conclude, the judge renders judgment about whether\\nconfinement is necessary and, if so, for how long. Typical confinements last from 6 months to 1 year,\\nbut an indefinite period can be specified too. In the latter case, the individual has periodic reviews and\\nassessments. In emergencies, the process stated above can be skipped and short-term commitment\\nmade, especially if the person is an imminent threat to themself or others.\\nBefore we move on, consider for a minute that a person who is accused of a crime is innocent until\\nproven guilty, has a trial, and if found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt (or almost complete certainty)\\nis only then incarcerated. This is not true for the mentally ill, who may be committed to a facility\\nwithout ever having committed a crime or having a trial, but simply because they were judged as having\\nthe potential to do so (or was seen as dangerous). This potential means that there must be “clear and\\nconvincing” proof, which the U.S. Supreme Court defines as 75% certainty. The standard to commit is'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n291\\nmuch different for those accused of criminal acts and those who are mentally ill.\\n \\n15.1.3. Criminal Commitment\\nWhen people are accused of crimes but found to be mentally unstable, they are usually sent to a mental\\nhealth institution for treatment. This is called criminal commitment. Individuals may plead not guilty\\nby reason of insanity (NGRI) or as it is also called, the insanity plea. When a defendant pleads NGRI\\nthey are acknowledging their guilt for the crime (actus rea) but wish to be seen as not guilty since they\\nwere mentally ill at the time (mens rea).\\nThe origins of the modern definition of insanity go back to Daniel M’Naghten in 1843 England. He\\nmurdered the secretary to British Prime Minister, Robert Peel, during an attempted assassination of the\\nPrime Minister. He was found to be not guilty due to delusions of persecution, which outraged the\\npublic and led to calls for a more precise definition of insanity. The M’Naghten rule states that having\\na mental disorder at the time of a crime does not mean the person was insane. The individual also had\\nto be unable to know right from wrong or comprehend the act as wrong. But how do you know what the\\nperson’s level of awareness was when the crime was committed?\\nDissatisfaction with the M’Haghten rule led some state and federal courts in the U.S. to adopt instead\\nthe irresistible impulse test (1887), which focused on the inability of a person to control their\\nbehaviors. The issue with this rule is in distinguishing when a person is unable to maintain control\\nrather than choosing not to exert control over their behavior. This meant there were two choices in the\\nU.S. in terms of how insanity was defined – the M’Haghten rule and the irresistible impulse test. A third\\ntest emerged in 1954 from the Durham v. United States case, though it was short-lived. The Durham\\ntest, or products test, stated that a person was not criminally responsible if their crime was a product\\nof a mental illness or defect. It offered some degree of flexibility for the courts but was viewed as too\\nflexible. Since almost anything can cause something else, the term product is too vague.\\nIn 1962, the American Law Institute (ALI) offered a compromise to the three precepts in use at the time.\\nThe American Law Institute standard stated that people are not criminally responsible for their\\nactions if, at the time of their crime, they had a mental disorder or defect that did not allow them to\\ndistinguish right from wrong and to obey the law. Though this became the standard, it also became\\ncontroversial when defense attorneys used it as the basis to have John Hinckley, accused of attempting\\nto assassinate President Ronald Regan, found not guilty by reason of insanity in 1982.\\nPublic uproar led the American Psychiatric Association to reiterate the stance of the M’Naghten test\\nand assert people were only insane if they did not know right from wrong when they committed their\\ncrime. The Federal Insanity Defense Reform ACT (IDRA) of 1984 “was the first comprehensive\\nfederal legislation governing the insanity defense and the disposition of individuals suffering from a\\nmental disease or defect who are involved in the criminal justice system.” The ACT included the\\nfollowing provisions:\\nsignificantly modified the standard for insanity previously applied in the federal courts\\nplaced the burden of proof on the defendant to establish the defense by clear and convincing\\nevidence\\nlimited the scope of expert testimony on ultimate legal issues\\neliminated the defense of diminished capacity, created a special verdict of “not guilty only by'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n292\\nreason of insanity,” which triggers a commitment proceeding\\nprovided for federal commitment of persons who become insane after having been found guilty or\\nwhile serving a federal prison sentence.\\nSource: https://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-634-insanity-defense-reform-act-1984\\nThis is the current standard in all federal courts and about half of all state courts, with Idaho, Kansas,\\nMontana, and Utah choosing to get rid of the insanity plea altogether.\\nFor more on the insanity plea, please visit:\\nhttps://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/08/05/487909967/with-no-insanity-defense-seriously-ill-\\npeople-end-up-in-prison\\nAnother possibility is for the jury to deliver a verdict of guilty but mentally ill (GBMI), effectively\\nacknowledging that the person did have a mental disorder when committing a crime, but the illness was\\nnot responsible for the crime itself. The jurors can then convict the accused and suggest they receive\\ntreatment. Though this looks like an excellent alternative, jurors are often confused by it (Melville &\\nNaimark, 2002), NGRI verdicts have not been reduced, and all prisoners have access to mental health\\ncare anyway. Hence it differs from a guilty verdict in name only (Slovenko, 2011; 2009).\\nA final concept critical to this discussion is whether the defendant is competent to stand trial and\\nrefers to the accused’s mental state at the time of psychiatric examination after arrest and before going\\nto trial. To be deemed competent, federal law dictates that the defendant must have a rational and\\nfactual understanding of the proceedings and be able to rationally consult with counsel when\\npresenting their defense (Mossman et al., 2007; Fitch, 2007). This condition guarantees criminal and\\ncivil rights and ensures the accused understands what is going on during the trial and can aid in their\\ndefense. If they are not fit or competent, then they can be hospitalized until their mental state improves.\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nForensic psychology is when clinical psychology is applied to the legal arena in terms of\\nassessment, treatment, and evaluation, though it can include research from other subfields to\\ninclude cognitive and social psychology.\\nCivil commitment occurs when a person acts in potentially dangerous ways to themselves or\\nothers and can be initiated by the person or the government.\\nDangerousness is defined as the person’s capacity of harming themselves or others and implies\\nphysical harm but not necessarily psychological abuse or the destruction of property.\\nCriminal commitment occurs when a person is accused of a crime but found to be mentally\\nunstable.\\nSeveral rules or tests have been attempted to determine if a person is responsible for their actions\\nat the time a crime was committed.

Patient’s Rights\\n \\nSection Learning Objectives\\nDescribe rights patients with mental illness have and identify key court cases.\\n \\nThe following are several rights that patients with mental illness have. They include:\\nRight to Treatment – In the 1966 case of Rouse v. Cameron, the D.C. District court said that the\\nright to treatment is a constitutional right, and failure to provide resources cannot be justified due\\nto insufficient resources. In the 1972 case of Wyatt v. Stickney, a federal court ruled that the state\\nof Alabama was constitutionally obligated to provide all people who were committed to\\ninstitutions with adequate treatment and had to offer more therapists, privacy, exercise, social\\ninteractions, and better living conditions for patients. In the case of O’Connor v. Donaldson\\n(1975), the court ruled that patient’s cases had to be reviewed periodically to see if they could be\\nreleased. As well, if they are not a danger and are able to survive on their own or with help from\\nfamily or friends, that they be released.\\nRight to Refuse Treatment – As patients have the right to request treatment, they too have the\\nright to refuse treatment such as biological treatment, psychotropic medications (Riggins v.\\nNevada, 1992), and electroconvulsive therapy.\\nRight to Less Restrictive Treatment – In Dixon v. Weinberger (1975), a U.S. District Court\\nruled that individuals have a right to receive treatment in facilities less restrictive than mental\\ninstitutions. The only patients who can be committed to hospitals are those unable to care for\\nthemselves.\\nRight to Live in a Community – The 1974 U.S. District Court case, Staff v. Miller, ruled that'),\n",

The Therapist-Client Relationship\\n \\nSection Learning Objectives\\nDescribe three concerns related to the therapist-client relationship.\\n \\nThree concerns are of paramount importance in terms of the therapist-client relationship. These include\\nthe following:\\nConfidentiality – As you might have learned in your introductory psychology course,\\nconfidentiality guarantees that information about you is not disseminated without your consent.\\nThis applies to students participating in research studies as well as patients seeing a therapist.\\nPrivileged communication – Confidentiality is an ethical principle while privileged\\ncommunication is a legal one, and states that confidential communications cannot be\\ndisseminated without the patient’s permission. There are a few exceptions to this which include\\nthe client being younger than 16, when they are a dependent elderly person and a victim of a\\ncrime, or when the patient is a danger to him or herself or others, to name a few.\\nDuty to Warn – In the 1976 Tarasoff v. the Board of Regents of the University of California\\nruling, the California Supreme Court said that a patient’s right to confidentiality ends when there\\nis a danger to the public, and that if a therapist determines that such a danger exists, they are\\nobligated to warn the potential victim. Tatiana Tarasoff, a student at UC, was stabbed to death by\\ngraduate student, Prosenjit Poddar in 1969, when she rejected his romantic overtures, and'),\n",

The case highlights the\\nfact that therapists have a legal and ethical obligation to their clients but, at the same time, a\\nlegal obligation to society. How exactly should they balance these competing obligations,\\nespecially when they are vague? The 1980 case of Thompson v. County of Alameda ruled that a\\ntherapist does not have a duty to warn if the threat is nonspecific.\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nThere are three concerns which are important where the therapist-client relationship is\\nconcerned – confidentiality, privileged communication, and the duty to warn.\\n \\nSection 15.3 Review Questions\\nWhat are the three concerns related to the therapist-client relationship?

We then moved to patient rights, such as the right to treatment\\nand, conversely, the right to refuse treatment.

We will explore disinhibited social engagement disorder in terms\\nof: (1) how the child presents and (2) the history of the child. Let’s start with how the child presents.\\nThese children, unlike children with reactive attachment disorder described below, tend to be overly\\nsocial and interact with complete strangers. The child may walk up to someone in a store they have\\nnever met and hug them or even walk away with them. They may do this without ever hesitating when\\nseparating from their caregiver and might not even look to check back with their caregiver.\\nIn terms of the history of the child, these children often experience impaired caregiving, which means\\nthat the caregiver does not sufficiently care for the child on a consistent basis.  This could result from a\\nchild simply not being attended by their caregivers. Perhaps the parent does not interact with them\\nregularly, or the basic needs of the child are not appropriately cared for, such as food, hygiene, and\\nshelter. The child may be in a setting in which there are not enough caregivers to care for them\\nconsistently (e.g., an orphanage in which there are only a few caretakers with several infants), or they\\nmay not have had one consistent caregiver (e.g., they moved from one foster care setting to another\\nregularly). These situations interrupt the attachment and security of a developing child. It should be'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n299\\nnoted that the child will have a developmental age of at least 9 months.\\nDisinhibited social engagement disorder may co-occur with developmental delays such as cognitive and\\nlanguage delays, stereotypies, and other signs of severe neglect. Signs of the disorder often persist even\\nafter these other signs of neglect are absent. As such, it is not uncommon for children with disinhibited\\nsocial engagement disorder to present with no current signs of neglect. The DSM adds that the\\ncondition can present in children who show no signs of disordered attachment. “Thus, disinhibited\\nsocial engagement disorder may be seen in children with a history of neglect who lack attachments or\\nwhose attachments to their caregivers range from disturbed to secure” (APA, 2022, pg. 299).\\nThe functional consequences of disinhibited social engagement disorder include impairment of a young\\nchild’s abilities to relate interpersonally to adults and peers. Social functioning and social competence\\nmay be impaired and there may be increased risk for peer conflicts and victimization.\\n      16.1.1.2. Prevalence. The prevalence of disinhibited social engagement disorder is largely\\nunknown (APA, 2022) and considered to be extremely rare. The DSM notes that prevalence is up to 2%\\nin low-income community populations in the United Kingdom.\\n      16.1.1.3. Comorbidity. Cognitive and language delays, autism spectrum disorder, as well as\\nstereotypies are often comorbid with disinhibited social engagement disorder. ADHD and externalizing\\ndisorders are often comorbid in younger children and in middle childhood (APA, 2022).\\n      16.1.2.4. Differential Diagnosis. Disinhibited social engagement disorder must be differentiated\\nfrom ADHD. Unlike ADHD, children with disinhibited social engagement disorder do not show\\ndifficulties with either attention or hyperactivity (APA, 2022).\\nAdditionally, the medical condition of Williams syndrome, caused by a partial chromosomal deletion,\\nmay mimic disinhibited social engagement disorder symptoms (Zeanah, et al., 2016). These children\\nstruggle with social discrimination and tend to be overly approaching to strangers. However, they\\ndisplay this behavior despite not having a history of neglect/trauma symptoms (Zeanah, et. al, 2016). As\\nsuch, if a child is socially disinhibited, but has no history of neglect, disinhibited social engagement\\ndisorder is not the likely diagnosis. In fact, it may be that the behavior is caused by a more medically-\\nbased etiology such as Williams syndrome.\\n \\n16.1.2. Reactive Attachment Disorder\\n      16.1.2.1. Clinical Presentation. We will discuss reactive attachment disorder in much the same\\nway as disinhibited social engagement disorder starting with how the child presents. Children with this\\ndisorder typically present as detached from others or emotionally withdrawn. They do not seek comfort\\nfrom caregivers or respond to physical touch when distressed. These children typically have low levels\\nof expressed emotions, particularly positive emotions. They may experience unexplained irritability,\\nsadness, and fearfulness.\\nIn terms of the history of the child, similar to disinhibited social engagement disorder, the child will\\nhave experienced a pattern of extremes of insufficient care manifested as one of the following: social\\nneglect or deprivation; repeated changes of primary caregivers that restrict their ability to form stable\\nattachments, and/or rearing in unusual settings that do not allow for the formation of attachments. The'),\n",

Reactive\\nattachment disorder impairs a young child’s ability to relate interpersonally to adults or peers and\\ncauses functional impairment across many domains of early childhood.\\n      16.1.2.2. Prevalence. The prevalence of reactive attachment disorder is largely unknown and\\nconsidered extremely rare.  Young children exposed to severe neglect often present with reactive\\nattachment disorder before being placed in foster care or institutions. Despite this, the disorder is\\nuncommon and occurs in less than 10% of neglected children, even when severe neglect has occurred\\n(APA, 2022).\\n      16.1.2.3. Comorbidity. Cognitive and language delays, severe malnutrition, as well as stereotypies\\nare often comorbid with reactive attachment disorder. There may be a comorbidity with ADHD, though\\nthis is not clearly established.\\n      16.1.2.4. Differential Diagnosis. Due to the significant deficit in emotional-social reciprocity,\\nautism spectrum disorder must be differentiated from reactive attachment disorder. Whether or not a\\nchild was neglected, and the presence or absence of restricted or repetitive behaviors/interests, help\\ndifferentiate the two disorders (APA, 2022). If a child has no history of severe neglect or abuse, the\\ndiagnosis of autism spectrum disorder is more likely than reactive attachment disorder. If the child does\\nnot have restricted/repetitive behaviors/interests, the child is not likely to be diagnosed with autism\\nspectrum disorder, and as such, deficits in social/emotional reciprocity are more likely to be explained\\nby reactive attachment disorder, particularly if there is a significant neglect/abuse history.\\nFor more on disinhibited social engagement disorder and reactive attachment disorder please visit:\\nhttps://opentext.wsu.edu/behavioral-disorders-childhood/chapter/module-4-disinhibited-social-engageme\\nnt-disorder-and-reactive-attachment/\\n \\n16.1.3. Pica\\n      16.1.3.1. Clinical Presentation. Pica is the act of eating items that are not food on a regular or\\nrecurring basis over a period of at least one month. These nonnutritive, nonfood substances could\\ninclude grass, chalk, dirt, paper, hair, soap, wool, paint, gum, pebbles, coal, ash, or starch, to name a\\nfew. Pica can impair physical functioning but any impairment in social functioning usually occurs in\\nconjunction with other disorders. The behavior is inappropriate to the developmental level of the child,\\nso it should not be diagnosed before age 2 to exclude developmentally normal mouthing of objects\\nleading to ingestion, typical of infants. Also, the behavior should not be part of a culturally supported or\\nsocially normative practice such as ingesting a particular grass for medicinal or spiritual purposes (APA,\\n2022). Pica is not often associated with specific biological abnormalities, though deficiencies in vitamins\\nand minerals such as iron and zinc, have been reported.\\nPica may occur more frequently in disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (or other mental health\\ndisorders); however, a clinician must be careful to ensure that the act of eating nonfood items is to a\\nhigher degree than would be expected if another disorder is present. For example, if a child regularly\\nattempts to eat grass because they like the oral stimulation of it, and are diagnosed with autism\\nspectrum disorder, a clinician must determine if the individual is attempting to ingest a nonfood item,'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n301\\nor if they are trying to orally stimulate. If the individual is only trying to orally stimulate, they would not\\nbe diagnosed with pica.\\n      16.1.3.2. Prevalence. Limited data suggests that the prevalence of pica is around 5% of school-\\nage children and a third of pregnant women engage in pica, especially if they have food insecurity (APA,\\n2022; Murray, Thomas, Hinz, Munsch, & Hilbert, 2018). Some studies indicate that pica is more\\ncommon in males than females (El-Nemer, Alian, Salah-Eldin, Khalil; 2014) whereas others do not show\\na significant difference between genders (APA, 2022; Murray et al., 2018). A worldwide meta-analysis\\nshowed a prevalence of 28% during pregnancy and/or the postpartum period (APA, 2022).\\n      16.1.3.3. Comorbidity. Autism spectrum disorder and intellectual developmental disorder\\n(intellectual disability) are the two most common comorbid diagnoses. Less common are schizophrenia\\nand OCD. Pica may also be comorbid with trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder), excoriation (skin-\\npicking) disorder, and avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder.\\n \\n16.1.4. Rumination Disorder\\n      16.1.4.1. Clinical Presentation. Rumination disorder is the frequent act of regurgitating food\\nover a period of at least 1 month with no medical explanation such as gastroesophageal reflux and in\\nthe absence of a body-image/weight-related reason such as anorexia, bulimia, and binge-eating\\ndisorder. An individual may rechew and then eject the food from the mouth or re-swallow (APA, 2022).\\nFunctional consequences of rumination disorder include growth delay due to malnutrition secondary to\\nrepeated regurgitation. Though the onset of the disorder can occur at any time during life, when it\\nbegins in infancy, the age at onset is between ages 3 and 12 months, and it can be fatal.\\n      16.1.4.2. Prevalence. Limited European data suggests a prevalence of 1% to 2% of grade-school-\\nage children.\\n      16.1.4.3. Comorbidity. Rumination disorder also occurs more frequently in individuals with an\\nintellectual disability (Olden, 2001). It can occur in the context of a concurrent medical condition or\\nanother mental disorder such as generalized anxiety disorder.\\n \\n16.1.5. Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder\\n      16.1.5.1. Clinical Presentation. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder is a new disorder to\\nthe DSM 5 (APA, 2013) and replaces and extends the DSM-IV diagnosis of feeding disorder of infancy or\\nearly childhood (Norris & Katzman, 2015). It is an eating or feeding disturbance associated with at least\\none of the following: 1) significant weight loss, 2) significant nutritional deficiency, 3) dependence on\\nenteral feeding or oral nutrition supplements, and 4) marked interference with psychosocial\\nfunctioning. The disturbance is not better explained due to a lack of available food or a culturally\\nsanctioned practice.\\nThe food avoidance or restriction may occur due to the sensory characteristics of qualities of food such\\nas its appearance, color, smell, texture, taste, or temperature. It may occur due to a conditioned'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n302\\nnegative response associated with food intake following, or in anticipation of, an aversive event such as\\nchoking, repeated vomiting, or a traumatic procedure. And for some, the food avoidance or restriction\\noccurs due to a lack of interest in eating or food.\\n      16.1.5.2. Prevalence. Prevalence rates are largely unknown. A study in Australia reported a\\nfrequency of 0.3% among individuals aged 15 years and up. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder is\\nmore common in children with autism spectrum disorder and when so, has a male predominance. This\\nis possibly due to sensory concerns and rigidity that leads to children having very specific preferences\\nfor foods. Children may actively refuse to eat many foods due to texture aversions. When autism\\nspectrum disorder is not comorbid, the disorder occurs about equally between males and females.\\n      16.1.5.3. Comorbidity. As mentioned, autism spectrum disorder is a common comorbid disorder.\\nOther neurodevelopmental disorders may be highly comorbid such as ADHD, intellectual development\\ndisorder (intellectual disability), anxiety disorders, and OCD (APA, 2022).\\n \\nFor more on pica, rumination disorder, and avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder please visit:\\nhttps://opentext.wsu.edu/behavioral-disorders-childhood/chapter/module-5-feeding-disorders/\\n \\n16.1.6. Enuresis\\n      16.1.6.1. Clinical Presentation. Enuresis is the repeated voiding of urine into bed or clothes and\\ncan be involuntary or intentional. It has occurred at least two times per week for the past three\\nconsecutive months. The child must also be at least five years of age. Mental health professionals can\\nspecify whether the enuresis is nocturnal only (i.e., urinary incontinence only while sleeping), diurnal\\nonly (i.e., urinary incontinence only while awake), or nocturnal and diurnal (i.e., both while asleep and\\nawake; APA, 2022). The nocturnal only type is most common and occurs during the first one-third of the\\nnight. Diurnal enuresis most commonly occurs in the early afternoon on school days or after coming\\nhome from school. The degree of impairment is a function of, “…the limitation on the child’s social\\nactivities (e.g., ineligibility for sleep-away camp) or its effect on the child’s self-esteem, the degree of\\nsocial ostracism by peers, and the anger, punishment, and rejection on the part of caregivers” (APA,\\n2022, pg. 401).\\n      16.1.6.2. Prevalence. Daytime incontinence has a prevalence between 3.2% and 9.0% in children\\naged 7 years, from 1.1.% to 4.2% in youth ages 11-13 years, and from 1.2% to 3.0% in adolescents ages\\n15-17 years of age. Nocturnal enuresis is more common in males than females.\\n      16.1.6.3. Comorbidity. Most children with enuresis do not have a comorbid mental disorder. That\\nsaid, the prevalence of comorbid behavioral and developmental symptoms does appear to be higher in\\nchildren with both diurnal and nocturnal enuresis than those without incontinence.\\n \\n16.1.7. Encopresis\\n      16.1.7.1. Clinical Presentation. Encopresis is defined as the repeated passage of feces into'),\n",

There has\\nbeen at least one such event each month for the past three months, and the individual must be at least\\nfour years of age. Mental health professionals will specify whether encopresis is with or without\\nconstipation and overflow incontinence (APA, 2022). The child often feels ashamed and may wish to\\navoid situations, such as going to camp, that might lead to embarrassment. Encopresis is associated\\nwith, “a significant decrease in health-related quality of life and family functioning, particularly in older\\nchildren” (APA, 2022, pg. 404). When the incontinence is clearly deliberate, oppositional defiant\\ndisorder or conduct disorder may also be present.\\n      16.1.7.2. Prevalence. Most children older than four years of age diagnosed with encopresis have\\nthe subtype “with constipation and overflow incontinence.” The disorder affects 1% to 4% of children in\\nhigh-income countries, while in some Asian countries a prevalence rate of 2% to 8% has been reported.\\nIt also affects children aged 4-6 years more than children aged 10-12 years. Encopresis is also higher\\namong children who were low-income youth or were abused or neglected early. The gender ratio\\nappears to be about equal in children younger than 5 years but is more common in boys than in girls\\namong older children.\\n      16.1.7.3. Comorbidity. Enuresis is often reported in children with encopresis, especially in\\nchildren not presenting with constipation and overflow incontinence.\\n \\nFor more on enuresis and encopresis please visit:\\nhttps://opentext.wsu.edu/behavioral-disorders-childhood/chapter/module-6-elimination-disorders/\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nA child with disinhibited social engagement disorder tends to be overly social and interact with\\ncomplete strangers and have experienced impaired caregiving, which means that the caregiver\\ndoes not sufficiently care for the child on a consistent basis.\\nA child with reactive attachment disorder do not seek comfort from caregivers or respond to\\nphysical touch when distressed and has experienced a pattern of extremes of insufficient care.\\nPica is the act of eating items that are not food on a regular or recurring basis and over a period\\nof at least one month.\\nRumination disorder is the frequent act of regurgitating food over a period of at least 1 month\\nwith no medical explanation such as gastroesophageal reflux and in the absence of a body-\\nimage/weight-related reason.\\nAvoidant/restrictive food intake disorder is associated with at least one of the following: 1)\\nsignificant weight loss, 2) significant nutritional deficiency, 3) dependence on enteral feeding or\\noral nutrition supplements, and 4) marked interference with psychosocial functioning.\\nEnuresis is the repeated voiding of urine into bed or clothes and can be involuntary or intentional.\\nIt has occurred at least two times a week for the past three consecutive months and the child\\nmust be at least 5 years of age.\\nEncopresis is defined as the repeated passage of feces into inappropriate places such as clothing'),\n",

Intellectual Developmental Disorder (Intellectual Disability)\\n      16.2.1.1. Clinical Presentation. At the core of an intellectual disability is a deficit in cognitive or\\nintellectual functioning. Historically, we labeled individuals with this presentation of deficits as having\\nmental retardation, but this term was changed to intellectual disability with the passage of Public Law\\n111-256, also called Rosa’s law, to combat stigmatization and misuse of the term. While the terms\\nintellectual disability and intellectual developmental disorder are considered interchangeable, we will\\nuse intellectual developmental disorder in this book.\\nWhen considering intellectual developmental disorder there are two primary areas of major deficits –\\nintellectual functioning (Criterion A) and adaptive functioning (Criterion B; APA, 2022).'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n305\\n      16.2.1.1.1. Intellectual functioning (Criterion A). Intellectual or cognitive functioning refers to\\nour ability to problem solve, understand and analyze complex material, think abstractly, absorb\\ninformation from our environment, learn from experience, plan, judge, and reason. Critical components\\ninclude working memory, verbal comprehension, quantitative reasoning, cognitive efficacy, and\\nperceptual reasoning. An individual with intellectual developmental disorder has a significant deficit in\\nthis area as confirmed by clinical assessment and individualized, standardized, culturally appropriate\\nintelligence testing. The DSM-5-TR states that those with intellectual developmental disorder have\\nscores approximately two standard deviations or more below the population mean. If a test has a\\nstandard deviation of 15 and a mean of 100, their scores will fall in the 65-75 range (70+5; APA, 2022).\\n      16.2.1.1.2. Adaptive functioning (Criterion B). Adaptive skills are those that help us\\nsuccessfully navigate our daily lives. Our ability to understand safety signs in our environment, make\\nappointments, interact with others, complete hygiene routines, etc. are examples of adaptive\\nfunctioning.  These are the skills one needs to live independently and be socially responsible.\\nIndividuals with intellectual developmental disorder typically have adaptive skills that are far below\\nwhat is expected given their chronological age.\\nAccording to the DSM-5-TR (APA, 2022) adaptive functioning involves adaptive reasoning in three main\\ndomains: conceptual, social, and practical. First, the conceptual domain (also called the academic\\ndomain) involves competence in memory, language, math reasoning, problem-solving, etc. Second, the\\nsocial domain involves being aware of the thoughts and feelings of other people, showing empathy,\\ninterpersonal communication skills, and social judgment, for example. Finally, the practical domain\\ninvolves learning and self-management across life settings such as job responsibilities, personal care,\\nand recreation.\\n      16.2.1.1.3. Onset of intellectual developmental disorder (Criterion C). It should be noted\\nthat a third criterion must also be met– the onset of deficits described in criteria A and B must be\\npresent early in the neurodevelopmental period. As such, it is most frequently diagnosed in children.\\nIntellectual developmental disorder is not something one would “acquire” in adulthood. If an individual\\nexperiences cognitive and adaptive function decline in later years, this is not considered intellectual\\ndevelopmental disorder (a neurodevelopmental disorder) but is more likely a neurocognitive disorder\\nthat may be due to a number of things such as traumatic brain injury or dementia. As such, although an\\nindividual can go undiagnosed until adulthood, and then as an adult be diagnosed with intellectual\\ndevelopmental disorder, there must be significant and undoubtable evidence of cognitive delay and\\nadaptive functioning delay in the early developmental period. Otherwise, an adult would not be\\ndiagnosed with intellectual developmental disorder.\\n      16.2.1.1.4. Severity specifiers. Rather than IQ scores, intellectual developmental disorder is\\nassigned a severity specifier based on the level of delays related to adaptive functioning. Essentially, the\\nmore support someone needs, the more severe the intellectual disability. Severity ranges from Mild\\n(least severe), to Moderate, to Severe, and Profound (most severe; APA, 2022). Severity is considered in\\nrelation to the three domains of conceptual, social, and practical. For instance, a specifier of severe\\nwould result the child having little understanding of written language or concepts involving numbers,\\nquantity, and money (conceptual domain), speech and communication being focused on the here and\\nnow within everyday events (social domain), and not being able to make responsible decisions regarding\\nthe well-being of self or others, necessitating supervision at all times (practical domain).\\n      16.2.1.1.5. Associated features. Individuals with intellectual developmental disorder have'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n306\\ndifficulties with social judgment, assessing risk, emotions, are gullible, and lack awareness. This can\\nlead to increased rates of accidental injury, being exploited by others, possible victimization or physical\\nand sexual abuse, and unintentional criminal involvement. They may also become distressed about their\\nintellectual limitations (APA, 2022).\\n      16.2.1.1.6. Clarification on nomenclature. The DSM-5-TR uses the term intellectual\\ndevelopment disorder to clarify its relationship with the ICD-11 classification system which uses the\\nterm Disorders of Intellectual Development. The equivalent term of intellectual disability is placed in\\nparentheses for continued use. It should be noted that both terms (i.e., intellectual developmental\\ndisorder and intellectual disability) are used in the medical and research literature, while the term\\nintellectual disability is more commonly used by educators, advocacy groups, and the lay public.\\n      16.2.1.2. Prevalence. Intellectual development disorder occurs in approximately 1% of the overall\\ngeneral population while the global prevalence varies by country and level of development. Prevalence\\nis 16 per 1,000 in middle-income countries but 9 per 1,000 in high-income countries (APA, 2022).\\nIntellectual development disorder is more common in males than females, although sex ratios are\\ninconsistent in the literature (APA, 2022; Einfeld & Emerson, 2008). It is hypothesized that the reason\\nthere is a higher occurrence of intellectual development disorder in males is due to general genetic\\nvulnerability, often linked to X chromosome issues that males experience (Harris, 2006). Prevalence is\\nhigher in youth than in adults and there are no significant differences between ethnoracial groups.\\n      16.2.1.3. Comorbidity. Intellectual development disorder is often comorbid with other medical\\nand physical conditions as well as other neurodevelopmental conditions including autism and ADHD.\\nMoreover, depression, bipolar, and anxiety disorders are often comorbid with intellectual development\\ndisorder. Impulse-control disorders, major neurocognitive disorder, and stereotypic movement disorder\\nare frequently comorbid (APA, 2022).\\n      16.2.1.4. Onset. Onset of intellectual development disorder is in the developmental period, though\\netiology and severity of brain dysfunction affect exact age and characteristic features at onset. For\\nindividuals with more severe intellectual development disorder, delayed motor, language, and social\\nmilestones are typical within the first 2 years of life. For individuals with mild intellectual development\\ndisorder, impairments may not be identifiable until school age when problems with academic learning\\nare evident.\\n \\n16.2.2. Specific Learning Disorder\\n      16.2.2.1. Clinical Presentation. A specific learning disorder is characterized by persistent\\ndifficulties learning critical academic skills during the years of formal schooling such as reading of\\nsingle words accurately and fluently or arithmetic calculation; performance of the affected academic\\nskills being well below expected for age; learning difficulties being apparent in the early school years\\nfor most individuals, and that the learning difficulties are considered “specific” for four reasons. First,\\nthe learning difficulties are not better explained by intellectual developmental disorder, global\\ndevelopmental delay, hearing or vision disorders, or neurological or motor disorders. Second, they\\ncannot be attributed to more general external factors such as economic or environmental disadvantage.\\nThird, they cannot be attributed to neurological disorders such as a pediatric stroke, motor disorders,\\nor to vision or hearing disorders. Fourth, a learning difficulty can be restricted to one academic skill or\\ndomain.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n307\\nHistorically, learning disorders were diagnosed when there was a significant discrepancy between an\\nindividual’s intellectual/cognitive ability (as measured by an intelligence test) and their academic\\nachievement (as measured by a standardized achievement test) as this was required by DSM-IV-TR\\ncriteria. This method is referred to as the discrepancy model. While many still use this model, and\\nnothing in the DSM-5-TR disallows it, the DSM-5 criteria were rewritten to allow more flexibility.\\nUltimately, a discrepancy between one’s IQ and academic achievement is no longer required; however,\\nthere must be specific data indicating an individual is preforming significantly below what would be\\nexpected given their chronological age.\\nIn addition to significant academic deficits, there must be evidence that efforts (e.g., tutoring, increased\\nand specialized instruction) to improve abilities within the specific area have been made before\\ndiagnosing a specific learning disorder. This is to ensure that an individual has had full access to\\neducational material and supports before a professional assigns a learning disorder diagnosis to them.\\nIn school systems, this is where tiered interventions have come into play (more on this in Section 7.5).\\n      16.2.2.1.1. Domain/subskill specific specifiers. Once an individual has been diagnosed with a\\nlearning disorder, all academic domains and subskills that have been impaired should be noted as\\nfollows:\\nWith impairment in reading – The individual has trouble comprehending material, reading\\nfluently and quickly, or reading words accurately.\\nWith impairment in mathematics – The individual has trouble with number sense,\\nmemorization of arithmetic facts, math reasoning, and calculation.\\nWith impairment in written expression – The individual has trouble with accurately spelling\\nwords, using correct punctuation and grammar, or with writing clearly and organized.\\n      16.2.2.1.2. Matters of dyslexia and dyscalculia. Technically, dyslexia and dyscalculia are not\\ndiagnoses in the DSM-5-TR, but are alternative terms used to describe learning disorders in reading\\n(dyslexia) and math (dyscalculia). Dyslexia refers to a pattern of learning difficulties characterized by\\nproblems with accurate or fluent word recognition, decoding, and spelling (APA, 2022). Dyscalculia\\nrefers to a pattern of learning difficulties characterized by “problems processing numerical information,\\nlearning arithmetic facts, and performing accurate or fluent calculations” (APA, 2022, pg. 78).\\nAlthough these two terms are used very frequently in school systems and by professionals such as\\nSpeech/Language Pathologists, they are not diagnoses and are considered alternative terms in the\\nDSM-5-TR. Instead, a mental health professional will diagnose a specific learning disorder with\\nimpairment in reading (for dyslexia) and a specific learning disorder with impairment in mathematics\\n(for dyscalculia). This is an excellent example of how professionals will sometimes discuss the same\\nphenomenon but use different terminology.\\nDifferences and Similarities between the Disorders\\nAlthough intellectual developmental disorder and specific learning disorder may seem very similar, it is\\nimportant not to confuse the two, as they are different. When thinking about both disorders, we have\\nthree distinct core areas to consider: adaptive functioning, cognitive/intellectual ability (IQ), and\\nacademic achievement. A rudimentarily way to think about this is with intellectual developmental\\ndisorder we are concerned with adaptive functioning and IQ, and with specific learning disorder we are\\nconcerned with IQ (sort of) and academic achievement. Although IQ matters (sort of) in both disorders,'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n308\\nthe reason it is important varies slightly. Because IQ is considered in both disorders, people often\\nintertwine and confuse the two.\\nLet’s take a minute and think about this: IQ is what we are cognitively able to do – what we can do.\\nAdaptive skills and academic achievement refer to what we are doing.\\nIntellectual developmental disorder. If we cannot perform in the average range on an IQ test and we\\nare not performing daily living tasks appropriately (for our chronological age –we would not expect a 7-\\nyear-old to make their own doctor’s appointment but would expect them to know to dial 911 in an\\nemergency), then this is indicative of intellectual developmental disorder (intellectual disability).\\nSpecific learning disorder. To differentiate between a specific learning disorder and intellectual\\ndevelopmental disorder, it is useful to consider the discrepancy between what is expected of an\\nindividual (what they can do) and what they are doing. If an individual cannot perform averagely\\nbecause their IQ is substantially below average, we could not expect them to perform at an average\\nlevel on academic tasks. For example, if a person’s IQ is 70 and they cannot function typically on\\ncognitive tasks, we would not expect them to achieve an academic score of 100, a 30-point jump from\\nwhat they can do to what they are doing. If an individual has an IQ of 70, we would expect their\\nacademic score to be around 70, which would not necessarily indicate a specific learning disorder, even\\nthough the score is low. In this case, they would be performing as expected, so the low score\\nachievement score would reflect low cognitive abilities resulting from intellectual development\\ndisorder. However, if there is a large discrepancy between what a person can do and what they are\\ndoing, for example, someone with an IQ of 100 scoring only a 70 in an academic achievement task, this\\ncould indicate a specific learning disorder.\\n \\n     16.2.2.2. Prevalence. Specific learning disorder occurs in approximately 5 to 15% of school-age\\nchildren in Brazil, Northern Ireland, and the United States. It is more common in males than females\\nand suicidal thoughts and behavior were found in U.S. adolescents aged 15 years in public school\\npresenting with poor reading ability (APA, 2022).\\n     16.2.2.3. Comorbidity. The different types of specific learning disorder are comorbid with one\\nanother (i.e., impairment in mathematics with reading), other neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g.,\\nADHD, ASD, developmental coordination disorder, and communication disorders), anxiety disorders,\\nbehavioral problems, and depressive disorders.\\n     16.2.2.4. Onset. Onset, recognition, and diagnosis of specific learning disorder typically occur\\nduring the elementary school years as this is when children are required to read, spell, write, and learn\\nmathematics. During early childhood and before the child starts school, there may be warning signs to\\ninclude delays or deficits in language, problems with rhyming or counting, and issues related to fine\\nmotor skills needed for writing. Specific learning disorder is lifelong, though an individual may\\nexperience a persistent shifting array of learning difficulties across the lifespan. According to APA\\n(2022), negative functional consequences occur across the lifespan and can include, “…lower academic\\nattainment, higher rates of high school dropout, lower rates of postsecondary education, high levels of\\npsychological distress and poorer overall mental health, higher rates of unemployment and\\nunderemployment, and lower incomes” (DSM-5-TR, pg. 84).'),\n",

For example, children that\\nare gifted, but have a reading disorder, often go undiagnosed because their deficits look like average\\nabilities to others. Here is an example to illustrate this:\\nA 2nd grader with a high cognitive ability earns all As. She excels in math and writing. In fact, she is far\\npast her peers in these areas. She has long learned her multiplication and division facts and is even\\nworking on some basic geometry skills. She can write and has been drafting paragraphs with ease and\\nhas even started learning to write essays. She loves math and writing, but she dislikes reading. When in\\nclass, she reads just like her peers, no more advanced, but right on 2nd grade level expectations. She\\nfinds reading to be more difficult, though, and it doesn’t come nearly as easy as math and writing.\\nHowever, because she is on track compared to her peers, her teachers and parents do not recognize\\nany issues – her grades are fine and her school standardized testing is not a problem.\\nWhat if you learned that her standardized math and writing scores matched her intellectual ability\\n(meaning her can do and is doing matched) but her reading score (is doing), although average, is well\\nbelow what would be expected given her IQ (can do) and is much lower than her math and writing\\nscores, despite still being an acceptable score? Would you say she may have a reading disorder? If you\\nsaid yes, you are right. If you said no, you may be right too. The fact is, this is a gray area. Previous\\nversions of the DSM would have made it easy to diagnose this child with a learning disorder in reading.\\nThe DSM-5-TR makes it a bit tougher. If this reading deficit, compared to her own abilities, caused\\napparent impairment (internal distress, preventing her from advancing in math and writing because her\\nreading abilities were lagging behind her other abilities), one would be inclined to diagnose her with a\\nspecific learning disorder in reading. However, one can see how this child could be overlooked and\\nundiagnosed for years.\\nNow let’s reverse the scenario. A 2nd grade girl has a diagnosis of an intellectual developmental\\ndisorder (intellectual disability). She struggles in all areas of academics. However, her math abilities\\nare even more behind than her reading and writing. Do you think one could make a case for a specific\\nlearning disorder in math? Theoretically, they could. But it takes a lot of careful documentation of\\nintervention attempts (see RTI discussion) and standardized testing that makes it undoubtedly clear\\nthat this is true (similar to the above example).\\nWhen an individual has an IQ that lands in an extreme (low or high), their weaknesses are often missed.\\nAs such, providers and educators must be careful not overlook potential specific learning disorders in\\nthese individuals.\\n \\nFor more on intellectual developmental and specific learning disorders please visit:\\nhttps://opentext.wsu.edu/behavioral-disorders-childhood/chapter/module-7-intellectual-disability-intellec\\ntual-developmental-disorder-ididd-learning-disorders/'),\n",

The essential features of ASD are twofold and include persistent\\nimpairment in reciprocal social communication and social interaction (Criterion A) and restricted,\\nrepetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities (Criterion B). It is described as a spectrum\\nbecause of the varying manifestations of the disorder due to severity of the autistic condition,\\ndevelopmental level, chronological level, and gender (APA, 2022).\\n     16.2.3.1.1. Criterion A: Social communication and social interaction. The child must present\\nwith all of the following symptoms. These include behaviors such as poor eye contact, dominating a\\nconversation/or lacking ability to maintain conversation due to absent or limited reciprocity (i.e., “to\\nand fro” conversation in the exchange of information), trouble with integrating verbal communication\\nwith nonverbal communication (e.g., for example using gestures, body language, or visual guiding), and\\nstruggles with maintaining friendships or relationships in general. Individuals with these difficulties\\nhave trouble understanding others’ perspectives, reading emotions, and inferring minor and subtle\\nsocial cues.\\n     16.2.3.1.2. Criterion B: Restricted and repetitive behaviors, interests, or activities.  The\\nchild must present with at least two of the following. First, they engage in stereotyped movement,\\nfrequently called stereotypy, such as hand flapping, spinning, or any repetitive movement that does not\\nhave an obvious function. They might display restricted or repetitive play such as lining up toys or\\nfixating on a part of a toy or button. Individuals may have excessive and restricted interests such as\\nbeing overly interested in history, dinosaurs, robotics, etc. Their interests may be so intense that, if\\ndiscussing their interests, it is difficult to get them to move on to a new topic, or it may be the only\\nthing about which they will engage in a conversation.\\nRestricted behaviors might include strict adherence to routines or schedules. Individuals may become\\nvery dysregulated if there is a new routine introduced or their routine is changed in any way. Moreover,\\nsensory concerns may be of particular relevance. Some individuals may seek out sensory stimulation\\n(sensory seeking behavior which is often referred to as “stimming”) as a soothing method. In fact, many\\nrepetitive movements can be seen as sensory stimulating. Examples, although not an exhaustive list, of\\n“stimming” may include rubbing hands on a rough material repetitively (tactile), putting objects on\\ntheir mouth/lips (oral), grunting or making nonfunctional vocalizations (vocal), or looking at lights or\\nvisual lines in odd ways (visual). Others may avoid certain sensory input which is known as a sensory\\naversion. For example, being very averse to certain textures, heightened sensitivity to pitch or volume\\nof noise, or bright lights.\\n     16.2.3.2. Diagnosing ASD. Individuals must exhibit both social communication concerns and\\nrestricted/repetitive behaviors/interests/activities to be diagnosed with ASD. Furthermore, these\\nsymptoms must have been present very early in development (APA, 2022).\\nAlthough language delays are common in children with ASD, they are not necessarily required.\\nMoreover, there is often a misconception that if a child has severe ASD, they are nonverbal, meaning\\nthey do not have language. This is not accurate. Children with ASD present very differently from each\\nother. Regarding ASD, Dr. Stephen Shore said, “If you’ve met one person with autism, you’ve met one\\nperson with autism.” In other words, one child with ASD may have symptoms that present very\\ndifferently from another child with ASD, but both children have ASD.\\n     16.2.3.3.

As such, clinicians will assign\\nspecifiers that identify if there is any evidence of language impairment or intellectual impairment. For\\nintellectual impairment, separate estimates of verbal and nonverbal skill are necessary. For language\\nimpairment, the clinician should consider receptive and expressive language skills separately since\\nreceptive may lag behind expressive language development in ASD.\\nMoreover, ASD is diagnosed in the context of current severity for both social communication\\nimpairments and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. The clinician will\\nassign a severity level to each of the two main criteria indicating how much support the individual\\nneeds. Level 3 indicates “Requiring very substantial support,” Level 2 means “Requiring substantial\\nsupport, and Level 1 states, “Requiring support.”\\n     16.2.3.4. Associated features. Intellectual and/or language impairment is common in many\\nindividuals with ASD. They may have difficulty seeing the world from another person’s perspective,\\ncalled a theory-of-mind deficit. Motor deficits are also present and can include odd gait, being clumsy,\\nand walking on tiptoes. Self-injury such as banging one’s head or biting one’s wrist are also common.\\n     16.2.3.5. Development and course. The behavioral features of ASD first become noticeable in\\nearly childhood as some children will present with a lack of interest in social interaction during their\\nfirst year of life. For children in which skills have been lost, parents and other caregivers may provide a\\nhistory showing gradual or relatively rapid deterioration in social behaviors or language skills occurring\\nbetween 12 and 24 months.\\nIn terms of symptoms, the first symptoms of ASD typically involve delayed language development, often\\naccompanied by lack of social interest or unusual social interactions, odd play patterns such as carrying\\na toy around but never playing with it, and unusual communication patterns such as knowing the\\nalphabet but not responding when their name is said. During the second year, odd and repetitive\\nbehaviors, and the absence of typical play become more apparent (APA, 2022).\\n     16.2.3.6. Prevalence. ASD has been reported in 1% to 2% of the U.S. population. Prevalence is\\nlower among African American (1.1%) and Latinx (0.8%) children compared to Caucasian children\\n(1.3%). In non-U.S. countries prevalence has approached 1% of the population. The male:female ratio\\nglobally is 3:1. Individuals with ASD are at greater risk for suicide death and children with ASD who\\nhad impaired social communication had a higher risk for self-harm with suicidal intent, suicidal\\nthoughts, and suicide plans by age 16 compared to those without the impaired social communication\\n(APA, 2022).\\n     16.2.3.7. Comorbidity. Comorbid disorders are very common for children with autism. Specifically,\\n70% of children with autism have a comorbid diagnosis. Further, 40% of children with autism have two\\nor more additional disorders. ASD is comorbid with intellectual developmental disorder and language\\ndisorder, specific learning difficulties, anxiety disorders, depression, ADHD, and avoidant/restrictive\\nfood intake disorder.\\n \\n16.2.4. Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder\\n     16.2.4.1. Clinical Presentation. Social (pragmatic) communication disorder is similar to\\nautism spectrum disorder in that social communication, whether verbal or nonverbal, is impacted.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n312\\nPragmatics refers to the social use of language and communication. To receive a diagnosis, all of the\\nfollowing must be present: 1) problems with using communication for social purposes such as greeting\\nor exchanging information, 2) difficulty with changing communication to match context or needs of the\\nlistener such as recognizing that one speaks softer in a classroom but louder at a football game, 3)\\ndifficultly following the rules for conversation or storytelling such as understanding that individuals\\nengaged in a conversation take turns speaking, and 4) problems understanding what is not explicitly\\nstated and nonliteral or ambiguous meanings of language such as idioms, humor, or metaphors.\\nAlthough, in many ways this may seem very similar to ASD, one of the biggest differences is that\\nrestricted or repetitive behaviors/interests are not present. It should be noted that, as individuals with\\nASD age, restricted/repetitive behaviors tend to decline. If this occurs, but the individual had a history\\nof the restricted/repetitive behaviors, they are still diagnosed with ASD, even if those behaviors are not\\ncurrently present, rather than social (pragmatic) communication disorder.\\n     16.2.4.2. Development and course. Social (pragmatic) communication disorder is not typically\\ndiagnosed in children under four years of age. By age 4 or 5 years, most children have obtained\\nadequate speech and language capabilities to allow for the identification of specific deficits in social\\ncommunication, though milder forms of the disorder may go undetected until early adolescence, when\\nlanguage and social interactions become more complex.\\n \\nMaking Sense of the Disorders\\nAutism spectrum disorder is distinguished from social (pragmatic) communication disorder by the\\npresence in ASD of restricted/repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities\\n…..\\nand their absence in social (pragmatic) communication disorder.\\n \\nNote to the Reader: Social (pragmatic) communication disorder was presented in this module only so\\nthat it can be distinguished from ASD in terms of a differential diagnosis. It will not be discussed going\\nfurther, and to be candid, the DSM does not really have much more to say about it either.\\n \\nFor more on autism spectrum disorder and social (pragmatic) communication disorder please visit:\\nhttps://opentext.wsu.edu/behavioral-disorders-childhood/chapter/module-8-autism-spectrum-disorder/\\n \\n16.2.5.

Whether efforts to stop such movements are successful is\\nquestionable. For children that are developing typically, directing attention to the movements, or\\ndistracting them from performing the movements, are successful. For children with\\nneurodevelopmental disorders, such efforts are less successful. The behavior displayed varies, but each\\nchild has their own signature or individually patterned behavior. Duration of the behavior is a few\\nseconds to several minutes or longer, while the frequency can vary from many occurrences during a\\nsingle day, to several weeks between episodes. The behaviors can occur during moments of boredom,\\nexcitement, stress, fatigue, or when the child is engrossed in other activities.\\nThe stereotypic movements cause impairment in social, academic, or other activities and can result in\\nself-injury. In fact, the mental health professional should specify if stereotypic movement disorder is\\nwith or without self-injurious behavior and whether the severity of the disorder is mild, moderate, or\\nsevere. A mild presentation is one in which the stereotypic movement is easily suppressed by a sensory\\nstimulus or distraction. Severe presentation would be characterized by continuous movements that\\ninterfere with daily living. The onset of the disorder is during the early developmental period, typically\\nwithin the first three years of life (APA, 2022).\\n     16.2.5.2. Prevalence. Stereotypic movement disorder is relatively rare, occurring in only about 3\\nto 4% of the general population. However, in individuals with intellectual developmental disorder\\n(intellectual disability), the prevalence rate is higher and occurs in about 4 to 16% of individuals. The\\nrisk is greater in individuals with severe intellectual developmental disorder.\\n     16.2.5.3. Comorbidity. Stereotypic movement disorder is often comorbid with other genetic and\\nbiologically based disorders such fragile X syndrome, Rett syndrome, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, as well as\\nother related conditions (Oliver, Petty, Ruddick, & Bacarese-Hamilton, 2012). Additionally, the disorder\\nis comorbid with ADHD, motor coordination problems, tics/Tourette’s disorder, and anxiety (APA, 2022).\\n     16.2.5.4. Differential diagnosis: Autism spectrum disorder. Although the repetitive movements\\nof stereotypic movement disorder may be reminiscent of behaviors seen in children with autism and\\nmay develop in the same developmental timeframe (e.g., around or before age 3) as autism spectrum\\ndisorder, children with stereotypic movement disorder do not display social communication and\\nreciprocity deficits. Moreover, they do not have circumscribed interests, difficulty with transitions,\\ndelayed speech, etc. The only displayed symptom related to autism spectrum disorder is the stereotypy\\nrelated to behavior. As the DSM says, “When autism spectrum disorder is present, stereotypic\\nmovement disorder is diagnosed only when there is self-injury or when the stereotypic behaviors are\\nsufficiently severe to become a focus of treatment” (APA, 2022, pg. 91).\\n     16.2.5.5. Differential diagnosis: Tic disorders. It may seem that distinguishing between a tic\\nand stereotyped movement would be difficult. However, there are a few factors that help differentiate\\nthe two. For example, tics tend to be variable, meaning they change over time. Stereotyped movements,\\nalthough they may change, tend to be more fixed and consistent. Moreover, stereotyped movements\\nrelated to stereotypic movement disorder tend to present earlier in development (before age 3) than tics\\nrelated to tic disorders do (mean age at onset 4-6 years). Finally, tics are typically quick, brief, and\\nfleeting, whereas stereotypic movements tend to be more prolonged and repetitive (APA, 2022).\\n     16.2.5.6. Differential diagnosis: OCD. The absence of obsessions in stereotypic movement\\ndisorder distinguishes it from obsessive-compulsive disorder. As the DSM says, “In OCD the individual\\nfeels driven to perform repetitive behaviors in response to an obsession or according to rules that must'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n314\\nbe applied rigidly, whereas in stereotypic movement disorder the behaviors are seemingly driven but\\napparently purposeless” (APA, 2022, pg. 92).\\nOCD-related disorders of trichotillomania (e.g., pulling hair) and excoriation (e.g., picking at skin) may\\nalso seem difficult to differentiate from stereotypic movement disorder. However, in trichotillomania\\nand excoriation, there tends to be a purpose for the behavior (e.g., extreme anxiety) and the behavior is\\nnot typically patterned or displayed in a rhythmic way. Whereas, in stereotypic movement disorder, the\\nbehaviors are more patterned or rhythmic. Stereotypic movement disorder has an earlier onset than\\nOCD-related disorders, which tends to be around puberty or later (APA, 2022).\\n \\n16.2.6. Tic Disorders\\n     16.2.6.1. Clinical Presentation. Tic disorders consist of three separate diagnoses. The most\\ncommonly known of the three is Tourette’s disorder. The second diagnosis is persistent (chronic) motor\\nor vocal tic disorder. The third is provisional tic disorder. We will start by discussing the tic disorders\\ngenerally and then move to specifics of each.\\n     16.2.6.1.1. General symptoms. These disorders present before adulthood (i.e., 18 years old).\\nTypically speaking, the time in which they present is between the ages of 4 and 6 and are most severe\\nin symptomology between the ages of 10 and 12.\\nFor all three disorders, tics are present. The DSM defines a tic as, “a sudden, rapid, recurrent,\\nnonrhythmic motor movement or vocalization (APA, 2022, pg. 93).  Tics can be either motor movements\\n(motor) or vocalizations (vocal). These can be simple, meaning they only involve one movement or\\nvocalization, or they can be complex, meaning they involve multiple movements, vocalizations, or a\\ncombination of movements and vocalizations within the same tic. Tics are largely considered to be\\ninvoluntary. It is common for tics to increase in severity for a period of time and then resolve or\\ndrastically reduce for a period of time (APA, 2022).\\n     16.2.6.1.2. Tourette’s disorder. Tourette’s disorder occurs when both motor and vocal tics are\\npresent. More than one motor tic must be present and at least one vocal tic must occur (APA, 2022) to\\nbe classified as Tourette’s disorder. The tics do not have to occur together and do not have to be\\ncomplex tics. Though tics may increase and decrease in frequency, they will have persisted for more\\nthan one year since the first tic onset.\\n     16.2.6.1.3. Persistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder. This is when either one or more\\nmotor tic or one or more vocal tic is present. However, vocal and motor tics are not both present (APA,\\n2022). These again can be simple or complex and only the presence of one tic is required. To receive\\nthis diagnosis, the individual must never have been diagnosed with Tourette’s disorder. The mental\\nhealth professional will specify whether the disorder presents with motor tics only or with vocal tics\\nonly, and though tics may increase and decrease in frequency, they will have persisted for more than\\none year since first tic onset.\\n     16.2.6.1.4. Provisional tic disorder. This diagnosis is used if there are single or multiple motor\\nand/or vocal tics, but they have been present for less than one year since first tic onset. The criteria for\\nTourette’s disorder or persistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder will never have been met.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n315\\n \\nMaking Sense of the Disorders\\nIn relation to motor disorders, note the following:\\nDiagnose Tourette’s disorder if there are more than one motor and at least one vocal tic (both\\ntypes are present) and this condition has persisted for more than one year.\\nDiagnose persistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder if one or more motor or vocal tics\\nare present (only one type is present) and this condition has persisted for more than one year.\\nDiagnose provisional tic disorder if there is a single or multiple motor and/or vocal tic(s) (some\\ntype of tic is present) but the condition has been present for less than one year.\\n \\n     16.2.6.2. Prevalence. Tic disorders are relatively rare. The CDC estimates that approximately 0.3%\\nof children are diagnosed with Tourette’s disorder (CDC, 2018) while the DSM reports an estimated 3\\nper 1,000 for the prevalence of clinically identified cases (APA, 2022). Tic disorders are more common\\nin males, and there are lower rates in African American and Latinx individuals.\\n      16.2.6.3. Comorbidity. Comorbid disorders are common, with 86% of individuals with Tourette’s\\ndisorder also having another psychological disorder (CDC, 2018, October). ADHD, disruptive behavior,\\nand OCD are commonly comorbid with tic disorders (APA, 2022) with about two-thirds of individuals\\nwith Tourette’s disorder also having ADHD and one-third having OCD (CDC, 2018, October).\\n      16.2.6.4. Differential Diagnosis. In terms of differential diagnosis, tic disorders must be\\ndistinguished from OCD and related disorders. The compulsions of OCD attempt to prevent or reduce\\nanxiety or distress and are usually performed in response to an obsession, while individuals with a tic\\ndisorder feel the need to perform the action in a particular fashion, equally on both sides of the body a\\nspecific number of times, or until a “just right” feeling is achieved. As for body-focused repetitive\\nbehavior disorders, they tend to be more goal-directed and complex than tics (APA, 2022).\\n \\nFor more on stereotypic movement and tic disorders please visit:\\nhttps://opentext.wsu.edu/behavioral-disorders-childhood/chapter/module-9-motor-related-disorders/\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:\\nIntellectual developmental disorder is characterized by intellectual functioning (Criterion A) and\\nadaptive functioning (Criterion B) deficits and they must occur during the developmental period.'),\n",

Essentially, an individual’s ability to\\nregulate their cognitions, emotions, and behaviors, are impaired. Individuals may lose things frequently,\\ntalk excessively, forget assignments/appointments, fidget frequently, move constantly, get distracted,\\nand struggle with organization. Symptoms also are required to be present in more than one setting. For\\nexample, if symptoms are only present at school, an individual would not be diagnosed with ADHD.\\nSymptoms are generally organized into two main categories: hyperactivity and impulsivity symptoms\\nand inattention symptoms. An individual receives a diagnosis of ADHD with the needed specifier if there\\nare: 1) at least six symptoms of inattention for this specifier, 2) at least six symptoms of hyperactivity\\nand impulsivity for this specifier, or 3) six of each of the preceding two for the combined specifier (APA,\\n2022). The exact symptoms an individual may experience are described below.\\n     16.3.1.1.1. Inattentive symptoms (A1). Children who are inattentive tend to lose things\\nnecessary for tasks or activities, do not listen when spoken to directly, do not follow through on\\ninstructions and fail to finish tasks, do not give close attention to details or make careless mistakes, and\\nare easily distracted by extraneous stimuli. They also are forgetful in daily activities; avoids, dislikes, or\\nare reluctant to partake of activities requiring sustained mental effort; fail to sustain attention in tasks\\nor play activities; and have problems organizing tasks and activities. Of these 9 symptoms, 6 or more\\nmust be displayed to receive the specifier and should have occurred for the past six months (APA,\\n2022).\\n     16.3.1.1.2. Hyperactivity and impulsivity symptoms (A2). These symptoms are related to\\nexcessive energy and movement as well as impulsivity. Individuals with these symptoms are often\\ndescribed as high energy or “on the go,” talkative, and fidgety. These children may have a hard time\\nwaiting their turn, standing still, remaining in their seat, or engaging in leisure activities quietly. They\\nblurt out answers before the question has been completed and often interrupt or intrude on others. Of\\nthese 9 symptoms, 6 or more must be displayed to receive the specifier and should have occurred for\\nthe past six months (APA, 2022).\\n     16.3.1.1.3. Combined presentation. To receive the combined presentation specifier, an individual\\nmust display at least six inattention symptoms and six hyperactivity and impulsivity symptoms for the\\npast six months (APA, 2022).\\n     16.3.1.2. Associated features. Individuals with ADHD (any specifier) display emotional\\ndysregulation or emotional impulsivity, are often quick to anger, easily frustrated, and overreact\\nemotionally. They may exhibit neurocognitive deficits and often show delays in language, motor, or\\nsocial development.\\n     16.3.1.3. Development and course. Excessive motor activity is often observed by parents when\\nthe child is a toddler but, “…symptoms are difficult to distinguish from highly variable normative\\nbehavior before age 4 years” (APA, 2022, pg. 71). In preschool, hyperactivity is most common. ADHD is\\nmost often identified during the elementary school years as the inattention becomes more prominent\\nand impairing. Hyperactivity becomes less prominent during adolescence and is confined to being\\nfidgety, restless, or impatient. In adulthood, impulsivity, inattention, and restlessness may remain\\nproblematic, even if hyperactivity has diminished.\\n     16.3.1.4. Prevalence. ADHD occurs in about 7.2% of children worldwide, with cross-national'),\n",

ADHD is more often\\ndiagnosed in males than in females. Females are more likely to present primarily with inattentive\\nfeatures. Because predominantly inattentive symptoms are not as disruptive and noticeable as\\nhyperactive/impulsive symptoms, predominantly inattentive presentations of ADHD may go\\nundiagnosed or be diagnosed much later than ADHD predominantly hyperactive/impulsive or combined\\npresentations. Finally, ADHD is a risk factor for suicidal ideation and behavior in children (APA, 2022).\\n     16.3.1.5. Comorbidity. According to the CDC, approximately 60% of children with ADHD have\\nanother comorbid disorder (CDC, 2018a, September). About 50% of children with ADHD combined\\npresentation, and about 25% of children with ADHD predominantly inattentive presentation, are also\\ndiagnosed with Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD). Conduct Disorder is also highly comorbid with\\nADHD (i.e., about 25% of youth with ADHD combined presentation) and most children and adolescents\\nwith disruptive mood dysregulation disorder have symptoms that also meet the criteria for ADHD (APA,\\n2022).\\nLearning disorders are also commonly comorbid with ADHD. However, differentiating if a learning\\ndisorder is present, in addition to ADHD, requires thorough evaluation (see differential discussion\\nbelow).\\nMood and anxiety disorders, as well as OCD and intermittent explosive disorder, are less likely to be\\ncomorbid than other behavioral disorders (CDC, 2018a, September). However, they do occur at a higher\\nrate in children with ADHD compared to children without ADHD (APA, 2022). Many individuals with\\nADHD report daytime sleepiness that could meet criteria for hypersomnolence disorder.\\n     16.3.1.6. Differential Diagnosis. ADHD should be distinguished from the following disorders:\\n     16.3.1.6.1. ODD. Because inattention and impulsivity can lead to noncompliance with rules,\\npsychologists need to carefully assess behaviors and differentiate between ADHD and ODD. For\\nexample, a child may be told to clean their room. A child with ADHD may (1) not hear or fully attend to\\nthe instruction and then not comply or (2) may hear the instruction, begin to clean their room, get\\ndistracted mid-way, and start playing with a toy they found, perhaps impulsively, while they are\\nsupposed to be cleaning. Although noncompliant with the command, they are not actively being defiant.\\nA child with ODD may be told to clean their room, and rather than comply, may actively defy the\\ncommand. Because symptoms of ADHD can lead to a higher risk of noncompliance, we must be careful\\nto not misperceive noncompliance with defiance. However, both can occur together (see comorbidity\\nsection above), and as such, when both are present, both will be diagnosed.\\n     16.3.1.6.2. Anxiety. Anxiety can lead to difficulty with concentration, fidgeting, and distractibility,\\nwhich overlap with some symptoms of ADHD. It is not uncommon for a child to be referred for concerns\\nrelated to ADHD, especially ADHD predominantly inattentive presentation, but may, in fact, be\\nexperiencing anxiety instead. Bear in mind that the inattention in anxiety disorders may be attributable\\nto worry and rumination. Differential diagnosis of anxiety versus ADHD is important because treatment\\nfor the two disorders is different.\\n     16.3.1.6.3. Learning disorders. Because symptoms of ADHD can impair school performance and\\nlearning, psychologists must differentiate between (1) general impairment in learning due to\\ninattentive, impulsiveness, etc. or (2) a specific impairment in an identified learning area (i.e., math,\\nreading, written expression).'),\n",

Both disorders share high levels of impulsive\\nbehavior, but serious aggression toward others is common with intermittent explosive disorder and not\\nADHD. As well, those with intermittent explosive disorder do not experience issues with sustaining\\nattention, characteristic of ADHD.\\n \\nFor more on ADHD please visit:\\nhttps://opentext.wsu.edu/behavioral-disorders-childhood/chapter/module-10-attention-deficit-hyperactivi\\nty-disorder/\\n \\n16.3.2. Oppositional Defiant Disorder\\n     16.3.2.1. Clinical Presentation. Oppositional defiant disorder is characterized by a child that is\\ndefiant/argumentative, angry/irritable, and vindictive, and has shown this pattern of behavior for at\\nleast six months. Of the eight possible symptoms, the child must present with at least four of them. In\\nterms of angry/irritable mood, they may lose their temper often, are easily annoyed or touchy, and are\\noften angry and resentful. In terms of argumentative/defiant behavior the child argues with authority\\nfigures, actively defies or refuses to comply, deliberately annoys others, or blames others for their\\nmistakes. Finally, they must have acted spiteful or vindictive at least twice within the past six months.\\nDistress occurs in the child’s immediate social context or affects social, occupational, educational, or\\nother important areas of functioning. Functional consequences of these behaviors include frequent\\nconflicts with parents, teachers, supervisors, peers, and romantic partners (APA, 2022). The disorder\\ntypically appears during the preschool years and rarely later than early adolescence.\\n     16.3.2.2. Prevalence. According to the DSM-5-TR, the cross-national prevalence of oppositional\\ndefiant disorder ranges from 1% to 11% with an average prevalence estimate of around 3.3%. The\\ndisorder is more common in boys than girls prior to adolescence (APA, 2022).\\n     16.3.2.3. Comorbidity. Oppositional defiant disorder occurs more often in children, adolescents,\\nand adults also diagnosed with ADHD and often precedes conduct disorder. Other comorbid disorders\\nare anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder. Rates of substance use disorders are higher in\\nadolescents and adults diagnosed with oppositional defiant disorder.\\n     16.3.2.4. Differential diagnosis. Oppositional defiant disorder should be distinguished from\\nconduct disorder. Both disorders bring the individual in conflict with adults and authority figures, but\\nthe behaviors of oppositional defiant disorder are usually less severe than conduct disorder and do not\\ninclude aggression toward people or animals, destruction of property, or a pattern of theft or deceit.\\nHowever, the impairment associated with oppositional defiant disorder may be equivalent or greater\\nthan that of conduct disorder. Finally, oppositional defiant disorder includes problems of emotional\\ndysregulation which are absent from conduct disorder.\\nOppositional defiant disorder shares with intermittent explosive disorder high rates of anger. However,\\nthose with intermittent explosive disorder often show serious aggression toward others that is not\\ncharacteristic of oppositional defiant disorder.\\nFinally, stressors may lead to emotional dysregulation, which can present as tantrums and oppositional'),\n",

The DSM says, “Temporal association with\\na stressor and symptom duration of less than 6 months after the resolution of the stressor may help\\ndistinguish adjustment disorder from oppositional defiant disorder” (APA, 2022).\\n \\n16.3.3. Conduct Disorder\\n     16.3.3.1. Clinical Presentation. Conduct disorder is a more severe behavioral disorder in which\\nan individual displays a disregard, not only for rules and authority, but also the rights and conditions of\\nhumans and/or animals. Behaviors that may be exhibited are stealing, fighting, cruelty to people or\\nanimals, fire-setting, running away from home, bullying or threatening others, using a weapon that can\\ncause harm, committing a mugging or armed robbery, forcing someone into sexual activity, deliberately\\ndestroying another person’s property, lying to obtain goods or favors, stealing items of nontrivial value\\nwithout confronting the victim, staying out at night in clear violation of parental rules, and being truant\\nfrom school. The preceding represents 15 symptoms of which the person must present with at least\\nthree in the past 12 months, with at least one criterion present in the past 6 months.\\nThere are three subtypes of conduct disorder focused on the age of onset. The childhood-onset type\\noccurs prior to age 10 while the adolescence-onset type occurs after age 10. The unspecified onset\\nsubtype is used when age of onset is unknown. Males usually receive the childhood-onset subtype and\\nhave disturbed peer relationships, likely were diagnosed with oppositional defiant disorder in early\\nchildhood, and typically have symptoms that meet full criteria for conduct disorder before puberty.\\nConduct disorder is often associated with limited prosocial emotions. To qualify for this specifier, at\\nleast two of the following characteristics must have been displayed persistently over the past 12 months\\nand in multiple relationships and settings. These include: a lack of remorse or guilt, a lack of concern\\nfor the feelings of others (callous – lack of empathy), being unconcerned about performance, and having\\nshallow or deficient affect.\\nFunctional consequences of these behaviors include being suspended or expulsed from school,\\nproblems in work adjustment, legal problems, sexually transmitted diseases, physical injury from\\naccidents or fights, and unplanned pregnancy. It is also associated with early onset of sexual behavior;\\nalcohol, tobacco, and illegal substances use; and reckless and risk-taking behaviors.\\nThe onset of conduct disorder occurs as early as the preschool years, but it is during middle childhood\\nthrough middle adolescence that the first significant symptoms usually emerge. The DSM states,\\n“Physically aggressive symptoms are more common than nonaggressive symptoms during childhood,\\nbut nonaggressive symptoms become more common than aggressive symptoms during adolescence”\\n(APA, 2022, pg. 534).\\n     16.3.3.2. Prevalence. In the United States and other largely high-income countries, one-year\\npopulation prevalence estimates range from 2% to more than 10%, with a median of 4%. In the United\\nStates, the lifetime prevalence was 12% among men and 7.1% among women. For those with conduct\\ndisorder, suicidal thoughts, suicidal attempts, and suicide occur at a higher-than-expected rate.\\nIn relation to sex and gender-related diagnostic issues, girls and women diagnosed with conduct\\ndisorder are more likely to display lying, truancy, running away, and prostitution while boys and men\\nwith the disorder exhibit fighting, stealing, vandalism, and school discipline problems. Both boys and'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n321\\nmen and girls and women display relational aggression, however, girls and women show less physical\\naggression than boys and men (APA, 2022).\\n     16.3.3.3. Comorbidity. Conduct disorder has been found to be comorbid with ADHD and\\noppositional defiant disorder, and this comorbid presentation predicts the poorest outcomes. Other\\ncomorbid disorders include specific learning disorder, anxiety disorders, depressive or bipolar\\ndisorders, and substance-related disorders.\\n     16.3.3.4. Differential diagnosis. Conduct disorder and intermittent explosive disorder share the\\nfeature of high rates of aggression, but the aggression in intermittent explosive disorder is limited to\\nimpulsive aggression that is not premeditated and does not seek to accomplish an aim such as money,\\npower, or intimidation. Additionally, nonaggressive symptoms of conduct disorder are not present in\\nintermittent explosive disorder.\\n \\n16.3.4. Intermittent Explosive Disorder\\n     16.3.4.1. Clinical Presentation. Intermittent explosive disorder is characterized by recurrent\\nbehavioral outbursts which represent a failure to control aggressive impulses. It is manifested by one of\\nthe following: 1) verbal or physical aggression toward property, animals, or other individuals which\\noccur twice a week on average, for up to three months; and 2) “…three behavioral outbursts involving\\ndamage or destruction of property and/or physical assault involving physical injury against animals or\\nother individuals occurring within a 12-month period” (APA, 2022). The level of aggressiveness\\ndisplayed by the individual is out of proportion with the experienced provocation or stressors and is not\\nfor the purpose of achieving a tangible objective such as money, power, or intimidation. The disorder\\nshould not be diagnosed in individuals younger than 6 years.\\nFunctional consequences of these behaviors include loss of friends, relatives, or marital instability in the\\nsocial domain, demotion or loss of employment in the occupational domain, or civil suits due to the\\naggressive behavior against person or property in the legal domain. There could also be criminal\\ncharges and financial loss due to the destruction of objects.\\n     16.3.4.2. Prevalence. The 1-year prevalence in the United States is about 2.6% with a lifetime\\nprevalence of 4.0%. When intermittent explosive disorder is comorbid with PTSD, the rate of lifetime\\nsuicide attempts increases (41%; APA, 2022).\\n     16.3.2.3. Comorbidity. Disorders comorbid with intermittent explosive disorder include depressive\\ndisorders, anxiety disorders, PTSD, bulimia, binge-eating disorder, and substance use disorders.\\nAdditionally, antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, ADHD, conduct disorder,\\nand oppositional defiant disorder are comorbid.\\n     16.3.2.4. Differential diagnosis. Both intermittent explosive disorder and ADHD share high levels\\nof impulsive behavior, but serious aggression toward others is common with intermittent explosive\\ndisorder and not ADHD. As well, those with intermittent explosive disorder do not experience issues\\nwith sustaining attention, characteristic of ADHD.\\nAntisocial and borderline personality disorders share the feature of recurrent, problematic impulsive\\naggressive outbursts but the level of impulsive aggression is higher with intermittent explosive'),\n",

Anxiety Disorders – Selective Mutism\\n     16.4.1.1. Clinical Presentation. Selective mutism is characterized by an absence of speech in\\nparticular social situations in which a person is expected to speak, such as at school or work, despite\\nspeaking in other situations. This lack of speech is not due to a communication disorder; does not occur\\nexclusively during the course of autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, or another psychotic\\ndisorder; or due to a lack of knowledge of, or comfort with, the spoken language required in a specific\\nsocial situation (APA, 2022).  For example, a child with selective mutism may speak fluently and freely\\nwith a trusted caregiver in the privacy of their home (providing evidence that the child does not have a\\nspeech, language, or communication disorder) but produces no speech at school with peers or a\\nteacher. The disturbance must have lasted for at least one month and is often marked by high social\\nanxiety.             According to the DSM, associated features include, “excessive shyness, fear of social\\nembarrassment, social isolation and withdrawal, clinging, compulsive traits, negativism, temper\\ntantrums, or mild oppositional behavior” (APA, 2022, pg. 222). The onset of the disorder is usually\\nbefore 5 years but may not become apparent until entry into school.\\n     16.4.1.2. Prevalence. Selective mutism is relatively rare, occurring in only 0.03% to 1.9% of the\\npopulation and is more common in young children than adolescents and adults. There is conflicting\\nevidence about gender, with some studies/samples showing equal distribution and others showing a\\nhigher prevalence in girls. Prevalence does not vary by race/ethnicity.\\n     16.4.1.3. Comorbidity. Selective mutism is highly comorbid with other anxiety disorders,\\nparticularly social anxiety disorder followed by separation anxiety disorder and specific phobia.\\nCommunication disorders or delays also appear in some children with selective mutism (APA, 2022).\\n \\n16.4.2. Anxiety Disorders – Separation Anxiety Disorder\\n     16.4.2.1. Clinical Presentation. Separation anxiety disorder is characterized by excessive fear\\nor anxiety concerning being separated from those to whom the individual is attached. A child may worry\\nabout the caregiver becoming seriously ill, dying, or being permanently separated from them, and show\\npersistent and excessive fear of or reluctance about being alone or without this figure at home or other\\nsettings. They may refuse to go to school or other places and worry about experiencing an untoward\\nevent such as getting lost or being kidnapped that causes separation from a major attachment figure.\\nThey may refuse to sleep in their own bed or have recurring nightmares that involve separation from\\ntheir attachment figure. These children may also have several physical manifestations of the anxiety\\nincluding headaches and stomachaches when they are separated from, or anticipate separation from,\\nthe major attachment figure. This fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent and has lasted for at least\\nfour weeks in children and adolescents. For adults, it must last 6 months or more.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n324\\nAdults or children with the disorder may exhibit social withdrawal, apathy, difficult concentrating or\\nplaying, and sadness and for children, the school refusal can lead to academic difficulties and social\\nisolation. Children may also display anger and act aggressively toward the person forcing separation\\nfrom their attachment figure and can become homesick. Children diagnosed with separation anxiety\\ndisorder are seen as demanding, intrusive, and in need of constant attention (APA, 2022).\\n     16.4.2.2. Prevalence. Separation anxiety disorder occurs in approximately 4% of children and\\ndecreases in prevalence from childhood through adolescence and adulthood. For instance, only 1.6% of\\nadolescents in the United States have the disorder and for adults, 12-month prevalence ranges from\\n0.9% to 1.9%. In toddlers, separation anxiety disorder occurs about equally between girls and boys but\\nin school-aged children, it is more prevalent for girls than boys.\\n     16.4.2.3. Comorbidity. Separation anxiety disorder is highly comorbid with other anxiety\\ndisorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder and specific phobia (APA, 2022).\\n \\nFor more on separation anxiety disorder and selective mutism please visit:\\nhttps://opentext.wsu.edu/behavioral-disorders-childhood/chapter/module-13-anxiety-disorders/\\n \\n16.4.3. Obsessive Compulsive and Related Disorders – Trichotillomania\\n     16.4.3.1. Clinical Presentation. Trichotillomania (Hair-Pulling) disorder is characterized by\\nan individual recurrently pulling their hair out and results in hair loss. Despite attempts to cease the\\nbehavior, the individual continues with it. These behaviors cause distress and impairment and may also\\nlead to other dermatological/medical conditions (APA, 2022).\\nHair pulling may be accompanied by a range of behaviors or rituals such as searching for a particular\\nkind of hair to pull such as those with a specific texture or color, pulling out hair in a specific way so\\nthat the root comes out intact, or visually examining or tactilely or orally manipulating the hair after it\\nis pulled out such as pulling the strand between the teeth. Pain does not routinely accompany hair\\npulling.\\nIt can be triggered by feelings of anxiety, boredom, and/or an increasing sense of tension, and may lead\\nto gratification, pleasure, or a sense of relief once the hair is pulled out. It has been noted that for some,\\nan “itch-like” or tingling sensation occurs and is alleviated once the hair has been pulled out. The act of\\nhair pulling does not usually occur in the presence of other people with the exception of immediate\\nfamily members. Some even have the urge to pull hair from other people or from pets, dolls, and other\\nfibrous materials (APA, 2022).\\nHair pulling can occur in infancy and will typically resolve during early development. Onset, though,\\nmost commonly coincides with, or follows, the onset of puberty. The usual course of trichotillomania is\\nchronic with waxing and waning of symptoms being typical if untreated. The disorder manifests\\nsimilarly across cultures and ethnic groups though there is not much data from non-Western regions.\\n     16.4.3.2. Prevalence. Trichotillomania occurs in 1% to 2% of adults and adolescents. Females are\\nmore often diagnosed with this disorder than males, in adulthood. However, in childhood, males and'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/psych.pdf'}, page_content='Fundamentals of Psychological Disorders\\n325\\nfemales are equally impacted.\\n     16.4.3.3. Comorbidity. The most common comorbid disorders are MDD and excoriation disorder.\\nOther repetitive body-focused symptoms such as nail-biting occur in most individuals with\\ntrichotillomania and may warrant an additional diagnosis of other specified obsessive-compulsive and\\nrelated disorder (APA, 2022).\\n \\n16.4.4. Obsessive Compulsive and Related Disorders – Excoriation\\n     16.4.4.1. Clinical Presentation. Excoriation (Skin-Picking) disorder is similar to\\ntrichotillomania, except it involves skin-picking which results in skin lesions. Despite attempts to cease\\nthe behavior, the individual continues with it. The skin picking causes impairment and may also lead to\\nother medical consequences (APA, 2022).\\nSkin picking can be triggered by feelings of anxiety, boredom, and/or an increasing sense of tension,\\nand may lead to gratification, pleasure, or a sense of relief once the skin or scab has been picked. It\\ninvolves behaviors such as searching for a particular kind of scab to pull and examining, playing with, or\\nswallowing the skin after it has been pulled. The act of skin picking usually does not occur in the\\npresence of other people, except immediate family members, and some individuals report picking the\\nskin of others. Pain is not typically associated with skin picking (APA, 2022).\\nExcoriation disorder usually begins during adolescence, commonly with or following the onset of\\npuberty, and begins with a dermatological condition such as acne. The course is chronic with some\\nwaxing and waning if untreated. It appears clinical features are similar across cultures, though there is\\nlimited data currently.\\n     16.4.4.2. Prevalence. In terms of excoriation disorder, an online survey of over 10,000 adults\\nbetween the ages of 18-69 and gender-matched to the U.S. population found that 2.1% self-identified as\\nhaving current excoriation disorder while 3.1% reported lifetime excoriation disorder. Community\\nsamples show that 75% or more of individuals diagnosed with the disorder are women.\\n     16.4.4.3. Comorbidity. OCD, trichotillomania, and MDD are comorbid with excoriation disorder,\\nwith depression comorbidity being more common in women. Other repetitive body-focused symptoms\\nsuch as nail-biting occur in most individuals with excoriation disorder and may warrant an additional\\ndiagnosis of other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder (APA, 2022).\\n \\nFor more on trichotillomania and excoriation disorder please visit:\\nhttps://opentext.wsu.edu/behavioral-disorders-childhood/chapter/module-14-obsessive-compulsive-and-r\\nelated-disorders/\\n \\nKey Takeaways\\nYou should have learned the following in this section:'),\n",
